rebelrats_falcon_m,WEAPON,Falcon missiles carry a shrapnel warhead designed to shred through lightly armored ships and exposed hulls.,,,,
rebelrats_hwacha_m,WEAPON,"Created from the Land Mattress Weapons Program, the Hwacha MLRS is simple in concept. The weapon fires mass amounts of Hwacha missiles to saturate an enemy's point defense grid, acting as decoys for larger, more potent, torpedos to hit the enemy.",,,,
rebelrats_custodian_m,WEAPON,The Custodian brings the much needed capability to bring down multiple targets with a single shot. Its built-in autoloader ensures that the gun is quickly fed flak shells during battle.,,,,
rebelrats_muridae_m,WEAPON,"Created by The Three Brothers Corporation and leased to Rebel Rat Industries, the launcher fires hyper-charged plasma bolts that melt through armour and hull. However, its downside is its relatively high flux requirements and its tendency to overheat that limits its capabilities.",,,,
rebelrats_arratoi_m,WEAPON,These are powerful railguns that fire standard issue anti-shield rounds. It was developed for the Rattus Modernization Project to augment the firepower of Rattus destroyers against increasingly hardy spacecraft shields.,,,,
rebelrats_petard_m,WEAPON,"Using laser activated nuclear pellets in a reinforced chamber, the Petard is a terrifying weapon to be struck by. Barrel rectifiers would guide the released energy into a concentrated beam and produce horrific results once hull is struck, working similar to what's found in Krysan pest control equipment.",,,,
rebelrats_braggador_m,WEAPON,"Created to bridge the gap between long ranged flak and smaller short ranged PD, the Braggador’s quad guns can easily shoot down enemy torpedoes or blunt incoming enemy bombing runs.",,,,

rebelrats_rattenjager_array_m,WEAPON,A built-in array of Snapper Hardkill APS for long-range interceptions,,,,
rebelrats_petardlauncher_m,WEAPON,"Seeing that the Petard conveniently came in ready-to-use canisters, it didn't take long for Krysans to mount thrusters and a rudimentary guidance system to make a simple, but effective, Directed Energy Weapon",,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_salvo,WEAPON,Triple rack for Huntsman Torpedos,,,,
rebelrats_gyrolauncher_m,WEAPON,"The Sorex's Gyrojet Launcher is an example of an old type of weapon making a resurgence in the Krysan Navy arsenal as miniaturization of technology outpaced weapons development. The utilization of gyrojets means that the ship can forgo the need of a complicated recoil management system and focus on having a larger payload size. A basic beam riding system keeps the rocket relatively on target, but could never keep up with fast moving targets.",,,,
,,,,,,
#MUS HUNTSMAN AUTOLOADER,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsmanx2_m,WEAPON,These torpedo tubes serve as the Mus' main anti-ship weapon to allow the Mus to punch above its weight class. The tubes utilizes an autoloader derived from the Rattus that ensures a quick rate of fire.,,,,
,,,,,,

rebelrats_huntsmanx2,WEAPON,Dual rack for the Huntsman Torpedo,,,,
rebelrats_hawker,WEAPON,The Hawker is a pirate's favorite. It utilizes time-fuzed canister shells to quickly bring down incoming groups of missiles without the need of complex guidance systems,,,,
rebelrats_pyroclast,WEAPON,The Pyroclast is the Federal Navy's answer to the Persean Sector's heavy torpedoes. It uses a hypercharged AM-shaped charge warhead that has armour penetration values measured in kilometers to allow it to break through heavy ship armor.,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_torp,WEAPON,A missile autoloader that has been fitted into the ship's center weapons module to quickly reload Huntsman torpedoes. ,,,,
rebelrats_ashford,WEAPON,The Ashford is comparable to Persean Sector PD lasers with its signature variable lense that allows it to be effective at all ranges. ,,,,
rebelrats_poacher_s,WEAPON,"The Poacher was an anti-ship weapon that was handed PD duties, favoring accuracy by volume like old CIWS designs. The turret's APIT shells coupled with an astounding rate of fire allows it to shred through frigate-grade armor plating quickly when enmassed.",,,,
rebelrats_poubelle,WEAPON,"Less of a missile and more of a flying IED that has been cobbled together from civilian components, the Poubelle is a credible threat as the lack of a complex thruster system has left room to stuff a more payload to compensate for the low-grade mining explosives.",,,,
rebelrats_chaff,WEAPON,Fires a canister full of hyper-spectral decoys to foil incoming enemy missiles.,,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTER WEAPONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_f,WEAPON,A fighter-mounted version of the Huntsman Torpedo stowed under the fuselage. Weight restrictions has led to downsizing the warhead to the minimum size.,,,,
rebelrats_ranger_f,WEAPON,"A stripped-down version of the Ranger, the cannon has a decreased fire rate for better heat management and less vibrations for the fighter's chassis.",,,,
rebelrats_hwacha_f,WEAPON,"Modified for fighter use, Hwachas have proven to be effective against fighters and now sees mass use with Krysan strike craft.",,,,
rebelrats_guardsman_f,WEAPON,Guardsman-Pattern turrets have their roots in old Krysan naval ship armaments as CIWS installations. They are the mainstay armaments of Hippo Skiffs and bombers due to their ubiquity and ability to function with minimal maintenance.,,,,
rebelrats_vaybchek,WEAPON,"Overcharged plasma mining tools, the Vaybchek purposefully overloads its mining cartridges to produce a higher output. This unsafe practice commonly led to premature breech explosions when done wrong, often injuring the crew.",,,,
rebelrats_pyroclast_f,WEAPON,"Removing the complex thruster system and fitted with a solid rocket motor, this version of the Pyroclast is meant to be fitted into the Olympian's magnetic bomb launcher.",,,,

rebelrats_falcon_f,WEAPON,A wing mounting bracket for a Falcon missile.,,,,
rebelrats_tephra_f,WEAPON,Uses an overclocked fusion torch to accelerate a long-rod penetrator to ludicrous speeds.,,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTERS,,,,,,
rebelrats_sultan,SHIP,"The Sultan is the Krysan Navy's premier fighter. It was built and designed by Rebel Rats to operate both in atmosphere and space, acting as a multi-role SSTO fighter. Its large arsenal allows it deal with most enemies in a battle space, especially with its underslung Huntsman torpedo to help it hunt larger spacecraft.

Will return to carrier once missiles are expended.",,,,
rebelrats_proctor,SHIP,"More engine than fighter, the Proctor is built to counter the thick PD grids in the Persean Sector. Its armaments allow it to hunt frigates, but quickly falters against concentrated enemy PD fire from a lack of shields despite extensive armor around crucial internal systems.",,,,
rebelrats_hippo,SHIP,"The Hippo is the standard skiff of Krysan Federal Navy. They allow Krysan ships to insert a platoon of marines into planetary battlespace or initiate boarding action against enemy ships and stations with breaching charges. Outside of dropship duties, the skiffs can act as impromptu PD boats to screen its mothership with its Guardsman turrets.",,,,
rebelrats_overseer,SHIP,"A light interceptor of the Krysan Federal Navy, the Overseer is a hardy fighter created by Arms & Armor. The craft comes equipped with a Hwacha missile rack and a pair of Ranger autocannons, making a wing of Overseers a threat to enemy shields.

Will return to its carrier once missiles are expended.",,,,
rebelrats_ministro,SHIP,"The Ministro is an unmanned interceptor designed by Rebel Rat Industries as a proposal to Krysan Navy officials to reduce pilot losses. It quickly found success with the advent of increasingly advanced drone control systems that allows finer control with unmanned systems.

Will return to carrier once missiles are expended.",,,,
rebelrats_patron_f,SHIP,"Cleverly set up microforges have allowed Federal ships to stuff an entire corvette into a hangar bay. Unfortunately, this means that only one Patron can be deployed per hangar bay with reduced capabilities.",,,,
rebelrats_daekon,SHIP,"A fast assault fighter built to break the shields of the enemy spacecraft with falcon missiles and shred armor plates with assault chainguns.

Will not return to carrier once missiles are expended.",,,,
rebelrats_dustero,SHIP,"When a group of Belters found the Talon to be lacking, the Dustero was their answer. However, it is arguable if the Dustero is any more effective than its Persean counterpart. Despite its firepower, the Dustero lacks shields, missiles, and armor that lends it very little survivability during battles.",,,,
,,,,,,
#BOMBERS,,,,,,
rebelrats_olympian,SHIP,"Despite its shambolic origins of being created from scavenged remains of Piranha bombers, the Olympian today is a capable bomber that dutifully does its job with enough armor and PD coverage to last it through bombing runs. A recurring joke among Olympian pilots is that the onboard warhead contains a Red Bombardier Rat as its payload.",,,,"""What kind of barbarians would ever use an animal as its guidance system? That's preposterous!"""
rebelrats_bluster,SHIP,The Bluster has its origins from juryrigged shuttlecraft in mining fleets who looked for a temporary solution to the growing pirate problem. A salvaged guardsman turret sits on top of the Bluster's engine block to serve as all around protection against enemy fightercraft.,,,,
rebelrats_conductor_bomber,SHIP,The Conductor is made to extend the anti-shield striking range of Federal Navy carriers. Persean Sector shields proved to be hardier than the then-current Krysan shield generators.,,,,
,,,,,,
#COMBAT SHIPS ,,,,,,
rebelrats_porcellus,SHIP,"Bristling with weaponry and cladded in thick composites, the Porcellus is the most common capital ship found in Krysan Federal Navy battlegroups. In the ship's hangars, the Porcellus carries a pair of skiffs that can conduct rapid military insertions, or act as PD screens during engagements. While the ship has been primarily designed to be a mobile artillery platform, it is readily equipped to host commanders and admirals as command centers for fleet engagements

The Porcellus was designed by the Arms and Armor Conglomerate and built in the massive orbital berths of Kaharian Naval Steelworks. Being based off of a venerable design in the old days of the Empire, the prototype model initially lacked effective PD coverage and long-ranged weaponry, but design improvements such as additional PD mounts and the installation of new technologies brought by the development of the Mobile Defence Doctrine made the Porcellus one of the safest ships in during battles.


At the ship’s core, four Barkley-Pattern Heavy-Duty AM-catalysed flux reactors are responsible for powering the ship’s Basilica-Model shield generator and its set of four massive H303 Torch Drives and two secondary H302 Torch Drives. 
",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_marmot,SHIP,"Marmot cruisers form the backbone of Krysan formations. The ship’s set of weapon mounts and hangars means that the ship can fill most roles that its captain may require. But most importantly, a Marmot allows captains to bring station-grade weaponry to engagements, making it a credible threat even in larger battles.

Designed by Veronica Witherfield, the Head Engineer of Rebel Rats, the Marmot is designed to fill out a multitude of roles in the field from squadron leader in flotillas, to acting as fire-support platforms in fleet battles. Veronica and Federal Navy officials came together and designed the ship with the Mobile Defence Doctrine in mind, giving the ship the needed structure and flux systems to handle the operation of a Doldrums Superheavy Railgun.

The ship became notable during its use in the Siege of Nutria against a large pirate armada hailing from the Persean Sector. Using the Doldrums, Marmots were able to lift the siege and chase the fleeing pirates back to the jump point with minimal losses. The battle would prove the ship's capabilities to Krysan High Command as an effective fire support vehicle in major engagements.

Equipped with two M405 Torch Drives, the Marmot can easily manoeuvre around the battlefield to take advantage of opportunities. For generating power, the ship uses two Barkley-Pattern Heavy-duty AM-catalysed Flux Reactors that power the ship’s torch drives and dual shield generators while a single Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor powers non-critical systems and acts as a secondary backup in the extremely unlikely case of dual reactor failure.
",,,,
rebelrats_jerboa,SHIP,"The Jerboa is the Federal Navy’s stealth cruiser. It employs redundant layers of stealth composites reduce sensor profile to conduct covert special operations. However, for the occasional ship-to-ship engagements, its Goedendag railgun provide the necessary firepower to duel enemy ships brave enough to spar with the ship.

Built by The Three Brothers Corporation, the Jerboa is the main warship of the Krysan Special Operations Command and is commonly used in commerce raiding and special recon missions. Apart from the Goedendag Railgun, the Jerboa is equipped with modular mounts and a small hangar bay that can be modified to suit the needs of the given mission.

The ship uses two heavily modified M503 Torch Drives fed by three Sleipnir-Pattern Hyper Cooled flux reactors. Apart from its use of stealth composites, the Jerboa also runs extensive hull cooling systems to hide it in the infrared spectrum, often storing waste heat in its 2 massive internal heat sinks that recycle the heat to power auxiliary systems until the ship can dump it out safely out of prying eyes.
",,,,
rebelrats_matkaboska,SHIP,"Despite lacking the mountings for a Doldrums, the Matka Boska makes up for it with heavy firepower and protection. The ship has a solid reputation for keeping its crew safe during heavy engagements thanks to its armor layout. Due to this apparent hardiness, the ship has become a favorite for officers to use as frontline command ships.

The Matka Boska was unfortunately conceived right before the beginning of the Mobile Defence Doctrine development. Due to this, the ship received neither suffiecient mountings nor sufficient reactors to accommodate the energy need of a Doldrums. Instead, the ship relies on thick slabs of frontal ablative armour and an arsenal of missiles to even out peer to peer fights.

The base design of the ship predates that of the Marmot and resembles that of archaic Krysan warships which Rebel Rat engineers took design cues from. Due to this, the Matka Boska not only boasts heavier armour than its contemporaries, but also better structural integrity and hardier citadels that effectively keeps its crew safe during engagements.

The ship is equipped with two Barkley-Pattern AM-catalysed flux reactors to power its singular H305 Torch Drive and its Basilica-Model shield generator. Multiple redundant subsystems are in place to make sure that the ship can get the crew back to safety including extensive escape skiff bays.
",,,,
rebelrats_steersman,SHIP,"The Steersman is an armoured cruiser built in belter shipyards meant to escort belter trade convoys from increasing pirate threats. The ship sports Poubelle Torpedos along its racks for anti-ship usage while an embrasure for a large weapon mount can be seen on its armoured nose.

A direct evolution from the Helmsman, the Steersman is a more serious take by Belters in creating a functional belter-made warship. Massive rivets dot the ship's hull alluding to the robust belter engineering and an armoured door hangs over the hangar for protection. Despite its firepower and armour, the ship can still falter to pressure from professionally made warships if care is not given in battle.

Hailing from the docks of the Asteroid Central Station, the Steersman represents the Belter's will to be true independents and its ultimate wish to remove piracy within its space. The ship was built to counteract the growing levels of piracy when pirates from the Persean Sector brought ever heavier ships and weapons to raid Belter space.

Its onboard fusion torch is a design derived from the most successful Helmsman homebrewed fusion torch drive nicknamed the Mammoth Fusion Torch. At its core, three Bobcat-Pattern flux reactors power the ship's onboard systems and torch drive.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_mellivora,SHIP,"Though thin skinned and lightly armed, the Mellivora provides a sufficient amount of strikecraft cover with its high-capacity hangars. During battles, it relies on its blistering speed and ample fighter coverage to strike opponents as its armaments is, at best, comparable to that of a frigate.

Realizing the need for a high mobility light carrier, Krysan High Command commissioned Arms & Armor to design the light carrier as the company possesses the most experience with designing carriers. This resulted in a quick turnover time with the ship's design and development and saw no major issues during its field tests.

With the ship's interiors being relatively new in design with numerous automated systems in place, sleep spaces in the Mellivora offer more privacy and headspace to its crew despite space restrictions. Unfortunately, onboard amenities such as the kitchen galley and commissary had to be reduced to maximize the remaining crewed space in the ship.

The ship is equipped with 4 M505 Fusion Torch Engines and is powered with the latest model flux reactors. Despite the Mellivora’s size, its onboard hangar facilities are comparatively more spacious for its designed capacity than on bigger Federal Navy ships such as the Marmot and Porcellus, increasing crew comfort during carrier operations.
",,,,
rebelrats_monax_p,SHIP,"Taking advantage of the Monax's commonality, pirates have retrofitted this Monax with snaking munition belts and homebrewed armor plates. What used to be its cargo bay has been replaced by hangar bays and its shuttle bays turned into concealed missile tubes. The extensive upgunning and uparmouring of the hull has earned it the light cruiser classification within Federal Navy records.

While at a glance, two Monax(P)s are seemingly alike, the lack of standardization with the pirate modifications of Monax(P)s means that no two ships are completely the same. One Monax(P) may sport slightly thicker armor while another may be having larger flux batteries as personal requirements differ from one captain to another.

Despite extensive upgrades to the hull, Any pirate captain, experienced enough, knows that the ship is never able to fight peer to peer enemy ships; with its lackluster flux reactor core and jury-rigged shield module, any Monax(P) can easily falter to dedicated enemy fire.
",,,,
rebelrats_rattus,SHIP,"The Rattus is an ancient design that predates the Krysan Federal Navy. Outdated, the design would be given a deep upgrade package by Rebel Rats, giving the ship updated subsystems and brand new Arms & Armor railguns. This upgrade would allow the Rattus fighting toe to toe against Persean Sector ships, predominantly during the First Contact Scuffle where misunderstandings between the Krysans and the Hegemony would lead to a brief conflict.

The Rattus was instrumental during Penance Day when disillusioned captains and nobles led a massive rebellion against the Krysan Empire. The conflict would last 8 long years and culminate in the dissolution of the Krysan Empire and the formation of the Federated States of Krysa. During the rebellion, it would slowly become a symbol of heroes, adventure and freedom among the youth and young captains.

Following the principles of thrust-gravity oriented design, the Rattus has a narrow hull with a vertical layout, leading to a smaller front cross section that allows Rattus captains to minimize the chances of the enemy landing a hit, though to the disdain of crewmembers needing to navigate up and down the ship’s tight vertical spaces with steep ladders.
",,,,
rebelrats_helmsman,SHIP,"Despite its makeshift appearance, the Helmsman’s barebones design gives it outstanding agility with its outrigged RCS thrusters. Its onboard shield generator was ripped off of a salvaged Monax cargo ship and tuned to the size of the Helmsman. Despite this, the ship is adequately armed for its size but can’t handle similarly sized ships that have proper flux cores installed.

With captains that can only be described as desperate daredevils with no regard for their own indemnity, the Helmsman can be manually constructed in the hands of any person desperate enough with the wanderlust for star travel or piracy. Its interior spaces are cramped and reminiscent of ancient planetary submersibles with parts of the crew sleeping in cramped bunks with very little headroom or privacy. 

Its fusion torch engine is homebrewed from a frankenstein of parts while its flux reactor is usually a Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor taken from a salvaged Monax.
",,,,
rebelrats_sorex,SHIP,"Considered unconventional in Krysan Admiralty for its lack of missile mounts, nevertheless, the Sorex is a capable destroyer with respectable forward firepower. They are often paired with another ship to make up for its lackluster point defence grid so that it can focus on anti-ship duties. The ship's autoloaders ensures that its weapons will engage at the max rate of fire. Its respectable level of protection will let it weather through scuffles.

Despite being overshadowed by the Rattus for its unwieldiness and its late introduction just after the Penance War, the Sorex has a reputation for being a comfortable ship by its crews as it has been designed around crew ergonomics. The ship was expected to perform long duration patrols or intermittent deep space anti-piracy missions. 

Unlike the Rattus, Sorex crews enjoy roomier and more modern accommodations with several quality of life measures taken for crew comfort, making it popular for captains who seek to enjoy picket duty in comfort. Its onboard galley is regarded to be like a hotel with its homely decorations and lighting acting as a third place for crew to get together in their free time.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_mus,SHIP,"Bearing unparalleled speed and brash firepower, the Mus is a menace on the battlefield when left unattended. The ship’s built-in plasma launchers and torpedo tubes allow it to spar with larger ships while its new S601 Fusion Torch gives it the speed to easily keep up with enemy frigates. However, this emphasis on movement meant that armor had to be sacrificed, leaivng the Mus with paper thin armor.

Rebel Rat Industries created the Mus to serve alongside the Rattus as its escort. As the newest addition to the Krysan Federal Navy, the Mus enjoys better shield generators that are more efficient at taking shots and provides wider coverage than older shield models.

Despite being a recent addition, the Mus quickly became a common sight along Krysan trade routes as a pursuit ship against any roving pirate ship.
",,,,
rebelrats_patron,SHIP,"A corvette built to provide PD coverage for warships, the Patron uses its bow mounted Felis LAWS to quickly sweep through fighter formations. Ironically, due to its diminutive size, the Patron is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by fighters due to the Felis LAWS’ limited firing arc.

Created by Arms & Armor, there was no expenses spared in the creation of the Patron. The interior has been carefully modelled to house the 4-man cockpit crew as comfortably as possible. The designers included a dedicated galley for the crew, which, as small as it is, goes a long way during long voyages for crew comfort. Unfortunately, its small size meant that the vessel has little in the way of protection, being comparable to armoured fighter craft.

The corvette is one of the few deep space capable ships that still maintains older-type fusion engines, that being two XS801 Pion Pulse Fusion Engines. The ship’s energy is maintained by a side mounted Minuitoid-Pattern flux reactor, a fairly recent development in the miniaturization of Flux Reactor technology.
",,,,
rebelrats_musrattus,SHIP,"An experimental ship designed to maximize elements of the Mobile Defence Doctrine, the Mus Rattus is an advanced frigate built around a small Doldrums Railgun and bleeding edge fusion drive tech. Recent advances in the miniaturization of Krysan technology allowed its designers to fit all the necessary components to fire the Doldrums without needing to shut down subsystems.

Despite miniaturization of ship technologies and subsystems, sacrifices had to be made as evident by the ship's cramped accommodations and amenities. This means that the ship has to be flown together with larger spacious ships during long-term deployments to sustain ship operations.",,,,
,,,,,,
#LOGISTICS SHIPS,,,,,,
rebelrats_pybara,SHIP,"The penultimate cargo carrier of the Naval Logistics Fleet, the Pybara's built around the relatively new Super Heavy Containers to satisfy the increasing needs of Krysan Federal Navy. Uniquely, its size can be attributed to the hull being designed around a Daedalus-type fusion torch that utilizes features inspired by acquired Persean Sector technology.

Developed in conjuction with the Fleet Logistics Improvement Program, the Three Brothers Corporation was tasked with the designing of a new heavy logistics ship based on the newly developed Super Heavy Containers that was supposed to speed up cargo turnover times. While the project was successful, the limited amount of docks that can accommodate the new line of ships and its rarer Daedalus-type engine prevented the Pybara from becoming the new system standard for fleet cargo carriers.

Despite unfortunate shortcomings, Pybara captains and crew enjoy more spacious accommodations than the smaller Monax thanks to extensive automation and additional onboard facilities its fighter detachment. Pybaras feature a couple of people mover cars along its spines to quickly shunt people and materials around to the delight of onboard off-duty crew and pilots.

At its core, the Pybara hosts a single Camel-Pattern Flux Reactor to power the large H101D Daedalus-type Fusion Torch while two Minuitoid Flux Reactors are responsible for powering the ship's various subsystems.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_monax,SHIP,"The Monax is the workhorse of the Naval Logistics Fleet with its ample cargo holds and extensive salvaging equipment. Nothing on the ship’s base model is underutilized or an embellishment, every part of the Monax is designed to be easily interchangeable to fit the user’s needs while its cargo holds have been maximized to carry as many cargo units as possible with its powerful torch drive. 

The freighter is a collaboration between Kaharian Naval Steelworks and Jerel’s Fuel Haulers, now called the Three Brother's Corporation after merging, in an attempt to standardize Krysan cargo hauling. The project, being hugely successful, made the Monax the most common freighter to be seen flying in Krysan trade fleets. The Monax’ ubiquity and focus in standardization in Krysan cargo fleets created a barter economy that revolved around trading parts and also allowed dedicated businesses that are solely created for servicing Monax freighters.

The ship is equipped with an M405 Torch Drive that has been factory tuned for maximum efficiency and is hooked up to a single Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor.
",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_panya,SHIP,"Despite its size, the Panya is more than capable of supporting local economies and small commerce fleets. Due to this, Federal Navy officers took interest in the ship's potential to extend the deep space endurance of flotillas as the ship was essentially nothing more than a few modular cargo holds with a fusion torch attached on its back. Like the Persean Sector's Buffalo, the Panya relies on escorts to carry it through its journeys safely.

The ship found its origins as a cheap solution to solving the shortage of service shuttles large enough to meet the growing demands of station constellations in Dragon's Blessing. Overtime, the Panya was able to grow out a niche of being the first choice for upcoming Krysan starfarers looking for a cheap cargo ship that demanded little maintenance.

With its diminutive size, the Panya's interiors can only be described as utilitarian and more akin to that of terrestrial cargo ships with individual cabins to host its measly number of crew. Fortunately for the crew, the ship utilizes extensive automation to ease the level of workload, meaning that onboard accommodations are more spacious than its larger brothers.

The ship is equipped with a Lynx-pattern flux reactor to power its systems and a single M303 Fusion Torch tuned down for efficiency.",,,,
rebelrats_rott,SHIP,"The Rott is a humble fuel tanker that can be compared to the Persean Sector's Dram. The Rott has enough fuel in its tanks to double the fuel range of a Federal navy flotilla. As such, the ship is often seen paired together with Panyas or other cargo haulers to extend the range of Krysan Expeditions.

The ship was initially conceived by The Three Brothers Corporation as a way to address the lack of standardization within the grassroots level of Krysan space economy. With its barebones structure and open truss structure, the Rott can easily be configured by any captain to their taste without the need for specialized tools.

Like the Panya, the interior of the Rott is utilitarian with little luxuries to speak of. Although, with onboard automation, Rott crews can expect at least a modicum of comfort as indicated by spaceworthy assurance laws with onboard accommodations created using mass-produced ""Unit Rooms"". This meant entire rooms can be easily renovated or replaced, assuring Rott captains that their ship accommodations can be easily updated.

The ship runs with a Lynx-Pattern flux reactor to power and systems while a pellet-fed DAEDALUS-type engine ensures efficient fuel consumption. ",,,,

rebelrats,FACTION,"Rats, rats, we are the rats
Celebrating yet another birthday bash
Michael, its your birthday today
Cake and ice-cream are on its way
And Michael's been such a good boy this year
Open up your gifts while we all cheer

The Krysan Federal Navy is the naval arm of the Federated States of Krysa responsible for enforcing the nation's celestial borders and safeguarding its citizens in the sector.

The Federated States of Krysa is a burgeoning polity governed by a directorial assembly who jointly serves as the collective head of state. The polity was formed from the, now defunct, Krysan Empire, after an interplanetary civil war. It is not known whether the nation is Domain in origin as there are no records of past colonization efforts that exists within Hegemony libraries. Nevertheless, it is clear to the sector that the nationstate has poised itself to be an opponent of the Hegemony; with a Krysan spokesperson stating the nation's disdain of the Hegemony's iron grip over the sector.

Despite the its apparent unity against hostile foreign powers, the nation is not without its own set of problems as the problem of rebel cells left over from the civil war still persist. Sporadic armed conflicts, not unlike that of pirate attacks, occur within the periphery of colonies, especially within the Tikus system where the influx of Persean Sector pirates and unruly debtors have lumped with rebel cells for a quick buck. Federal interdiction flotillas are often seen patrolling major trade routes to deter pirates while undercover agents keep foreign agents and rebel cells in check.

Regardless of its problems, the Federated States of Krysa remain stalwart and lustrous against the sea of darkness of the decaying Persean Sector. The nation is always optimistic with the prospect of finding new planets to colonize and expand its own domain.

Most importantly, instilled within every citizen is the nation's founding tenets that give them a common purpose, accompanied by its often heard motto:

""In the will of the gods, we fervently live.""

#PLANETS,,,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_planet,CUSTOM,"The planet serves as an example of the nation’s conviction to its founding tenets, manifesting itself in the people's ability to heal the planet's grievous wounds earned from its long history of conflict.

Today, Krysa presents itself to the sector as one of the most prosperous places to visit, bearing natural features similar to that of Old Earth despite nearly turning into an arid hellscape more than half a century earlier. Upon closer inspection, scars of past conflicts can be seen from with huge craters long filled by fauna.",,,,
rebelrats_malus_planet,CUSTOM,"Lawless is the word that can describe Malus. Despite its arid wastelands, small settlements pockmark around the planet's remaining major water sources, ranging from hastily made shanty towns, to relatively well-built hab towns that host their own spaceports. Whatever authority available is largely self-imposed through the use of force with shady backroom deals and smuggling by undesirables as the norm in the major settlements.

It was only recent when it became a hub of pirate activity. Its history goes far back into the days of the Empire when rebels used Malus as a smuggling port which eventually developed into hubs for undesirables to flock towards which inevitably grew to become its own independent entity.

rebelrats_magawa_moon,CUSTOM,"Gigantic orbital berths orbiting around the planet dutifully service the numerous civilian freighters who have arrived to load and offload their holds. Magawan defence stations in the horizon orbit ponderously as a reminder of the planet’s grim history of multiple bombardments.

Despite its scarred looks due to decades of conflict, Magawa hosts one of the largest subterranean complexes of fortresses in the sector. These were built during the time of the Penance War from the vast network of old mining tunnels. Today, many of the former surface emplacements have been converted into civilian use, with the biggest ones eventually developing into fully fledged dome cities.
",,,,
rebelrats_rodentia_planet,CUSTOM,"The humble green giant has been the source of many Krysan folk tales and superstitions, often cited by olden folks to be where gods reside with their mountains of emerald riches. However, in contrast, children often joke that the gas giant's vivid hue is a result of the sheer amount of rat flatulence.

Today, Rodentia is home to the largest orbital refineries of Krysa, fuelling the armadas of the Federal Navy and housing the berths of the Krysan Federal Auxiliary Corps. Around the planet, trade fleets can be observed using the green giant’s immense gravity to save fuel via slingshots, providing a beautiful demonstration of graceful gravitational manoeuvres akin to that of old Earth.",,,,
rebelrats_nutria_planet,CUSTOM,"Amusingly referred to as the system's supermarket, Nutria is home to the largest settlement of independent traders second only to the Asteroid Central Station. The city of Spalax can be seen with its concourse of markets spanning the breadth of the city next to its equally gigantic space port that accommodates the flow of trade between Krysa and the rest of the Persean Sector.
",,,,
rebelrats_tikus_gasGiant,CUSTOM,"Like Rodentia, Tikus I has orbital refineries dotting across the planet's orbit, routinely sending out teams to mine the giant of its precious gas. The gas giant is the beating heart of the system's inhabitants, providing the necessary fuel for interstellar return trips. In the future, the gas giant is expected to overtake Rodentia as the nation's main source of fuel.",,,,
rebelrats_tikusII_planet,CUSTOM,"With relatively mild climates, rich ore and crop compatible soils, Tikus II easily became a prime target for Krysan colonisation efforts. While Tikus II is described as a jungle planet, it is far from being a single biome. Tikus II has a complex system of biomes with equatorial regions hosting the densest concentrations of flora and fauna while its highest peaks are just barely breathable for individuals due to the planet's thick atmosphere.",,,,
rebelrats_tikusIII_planet,CUSTOM,"Tikus III, despite its almost destitute geography, is host to numerous independent settlements that popped up during Krysan colonisation efforts. The settlements on the planet huddle around the systems of natural caves and tunnels that hosts the few places that settlers can actively grow food such as mushrooms and low-light crops.

Outside of what little crops can be exported, settlers also take to mining the pockets of gas and send it out to be refined on Tikus I as a external source of credits for the planet's economy.",,,,

#STATIONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_powerstation,CUSTOM,A collector station designed by The Three Brothers Corporation to consume the power of the sun and beam it back to Krysan orbital power stations.,,,,
rebelrats_powerstation_interaction,CUSTOM,Rising thermal signatures eminating from the station's internals indicate massive reactors reactivating for a potential scuffle. Your gunnery officer promptly informs you that numerous targeting lasers are painting your fleet.,,,,
rebelrats_rod_station,CUSTOM,A station built by Rebel Rat Industries to extract the resources of Rodentia.,,,,
rebelrats_outerstation,CUSTOM,"A station made of massive cobbled together asteroids, Asteroid Central Station serves as the home port for miners and smugglers in the system. The massive station was once a humble outpost owned by a now defunct mining company and later rapidly expanded out of necessity as numerous refugees fled to the outpost during the Penance War.

Despite its ponderous appearance, the station is lightly-armed with very few large guns to speak off. The few dedicated defence modules that can be seen are a handful of jury-rigged gun platforms not too dissimilar to those found on Pirate or Pather stations.
