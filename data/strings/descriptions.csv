rebelrats_hippo,SHIP,"The Hippo is the standard skiff of Krysan Federal Navy. They allow Krysan ships to insert a platoon of marines into planetary battlespace or initiate boarding action against enemy ships and stations with breaching charges. Outside of dropship duties, the skiffs can act as impromptu PD boats to screen its mothership with its Guardsman turrets.",,,,
rebelrats_overseer,SHIP,"A light interceptor of the Krysan Federal Navy, the Overseer is a hardy fighter created by Arms & Armor from analyzing Persean Broadswords. The craft comes equipped with a Hwacha missile rack and a pair of Ranger autocannons to allow it to spar with enemy fighters.

Will return to its carrier once missiles are expended.",,,,

A recurring joke among Olympian pilots is that the warhead contains a Red Bombardier Rat in reference of the color.",,,,"""What kind of barbarians would ever use an animal as its guidance system? That's preposterous!"""
rebelrats_bluster,SHIP,Converted civilian shuttles that have been retrofitted with  new engines and overcharged mining blasters for use against ships.,,,,
rebelrats_conductor_bomber,SHIP,A fast strike bomber made when Persean Sector shields proved to be hardier than Krysan shield generators. Carries two Tephra rockets to break shields.,,,,
,,,,,,
#COMBAT SHIPS ,,,,,,
rebelrats_porcellus,SHIP,"Bristling with weaponry and cladded in thick composites, the Porcellus is the hammer for Federal Navy battlegroups. It carries a wing of skiffs to conduct rapid military insertions, or act as PD screens during engagements. 

The ship was designed by the Arms and Armor Conglomerate and built in the massive orbital berths of Kaharian Naval Steelworks. Initially, the prototype model lacked sufficient PD coverage and long-ranged weaponry, but later developments added more PD mounts and the Doldrums railgun. making the Porcellus one of the safest ships to be in during battles.

At the shipâ€™s core, four Barkley-Pattern Heavy-Duty AM flux reactors are responsible for powering the shipâ€™s Basilica-Model shield generator and its set of four massive H303 Torch Drives and two secondary H302 Torch Drives. 
",,,,
rebelrats_chevrotain,SHIP,"Representing a new paradigm in Krysan naval doctrine, the Chevrotain is their response to Persean Sector's carriers. Its unique cylindrical hangar bay give ample storage for fighters while 24 VLS cells provide ample missile coverage. In battle, the ship is equipped to service the needs of Fleet Admirals during major operations, with multiple machines allowing for rapid processing of battlefield information.

Encounters with Persean-built carriers led to the re-evaluation of the Mobile Defence Doctrine. Afterwards, the Federal Design Bureau issued a new procurement program indicating the project requirements to related companies. Its introduction saw resounding acceptance between flag officers who valued the ship's endurance and ability to project power beyond the Federation's celestial territories.

Onboard crew often commented that life on the ship were like travelling in older gravships, referencing to the Chevrotain's use of rotating drums to generate gravity while paragravity generators are turned off during long endurance operations. ",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_marmot,SHIP,"Marmot cruisers form the backbone of Krysan formations. The ship is designed to fill most roles that its captain may require. But most importantly, a Marmot allows captains to bring station-grade weaponry to engagements, making it a credible threat even in larger battles.

Designed by Veronica Witherfield, the Head Engineer of Rebel Rats, the Marmot is designed to fill out a multitude of roles in the field from squadron leader in flotillas, to acting as fire-support platforms in fleet battles. Veronica and Federal Navy officials came together and designed the ship with the Mobile Defence Doctrine in mind, giving the ship the needed structure and flux systems to handle the operation of the Doldrums Superheavy Railgun.

The ship became notable during the Siege of Nutria against a large pirate armada hailing from the Persean Sector. Using the Doldrums, Marmots were able to lift the siege and chase the fleeing pirates back to the jump point with minimal losses, proving the viability of the Mobile Defence Doctrine to Krysan High Command against hostile Persean Sector elements.

Equipped with four M405 Torch Drives, the Marmot can easily manoeuvre around the battlefield to take advantage of opportunities. For generating power, the ship uses two Barkley-Pattern Heavy-duty AM-catalysed Flux Reactors to power the shipâ€™s torch drives and dual shield generators while a single Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor powers non-critical systems and acts as a secondary backup in the extremely unlikely case of dual reactor failure.
",,,,
rebelrats_jerboa,SHIP,"The Jerboa is the main warship of the Krysan Special Espionage Command, often used to covertly conduct surveillance and reconnaissance operations. To do so, the ship employs a multispectral approach of redundant layers of stealth composites, coolants, heatsinks, and flux management systems to reduce sensor detection range. During ship-to-ship engagements, the Jerboa will use its railgun to surprise unknowing captains and equalize the field of battle.

While total stealth was deemed to be impossible prior to the discovery of phase technology by Krysan scientists, making a vehicle less visible to sensors has always been done, even in space. With this in mind, the Jerboa has earned a reputation for startling unaware ship captains, gaining the nickname ""Dreadship"" for its ungainly stealth optimized appearance. In the field, Jerboa crews often tether themselves to asteroids or large bodies to better mask its presence and to be able to dump stored heat into the larger body.

Built by The Three Brothers Corporation, the Jerboa is designed with extremely low visiblity in mind. The ship utilizes so called ""Black Rat"" stealth composites as a multispectral camouflage to reduce its sensor profile while thermal manangement systems work in tandem to reduce thermal detection through the redirection and storage of heat through massive heatsinks.

The ship uses two heavily modified M503 Torch Drives fed by three hypercooled Sleipnir-Pattern flux reactors. Apart from its use of stealth composites, the Jerboa also runs extensive hull thermal management systems to hide it in the infrared spectrum, often storing waste heat in its 2 massive internal heat sinks that recycle the heat to power auxiliary systems until the ship can dump it out safely away from prying eyes.
",,,,
rebelrats_matkaboska,SHIP,"Despite lacking station-grade weaponry, the Matka Boska makes up for it with heavy firepower and protection. The ship has a solid reputation for keeping its crew safe during heavy engagements thanks to its Central Battery armor layout. Due to this apparent hardiness, the ship has become a favorite for officers to use as frontline command ships.

The Matka Boska was unfortunately conceived right before the implementation of the Mobile Defence Doctrine development. Due to this, the ship has neither the hull reinforcement nor sufficiently sized reactors to accommodate the energy needs of a Doldrums. Instead, the ship relies on frontal ablative armour and an arsenal of missiles to even out peer to peer fights.

Rebel Rat engineers took inspiration from archaic Krysan warships for the ship's design. Due to this, Matka Boskas boast better structural integrity and a hardier citadel that effectively keeps its crew safe even during heavy engagements.

The interior of the ship is as utilitarian as the outside hardiness. Extensive structural reinforcement meant crew amenities are kept to minimal standards but do have some personal privacy in mind. The crew bunks resembled capsule rooms with storage, work surfaces, and other basic amenities installed within the rectangular confines of the bunk. Yet, its most iconic space is its narrow multi-story mess hall that resembled food bazaars found in Lycoria City, Krysa

The ship is equipped with two Barkley-Pattern AM flux reactors to power its single H305 Torch Drive and Basilica-Model shield generator. Multiple redundant subsystems ensure that crew are kept in relative safety. This includes extensive escape rafts, hardened egress routes, and armored muster bays for damage control crews.
",,,,
rebelrats_steersman,SHIP,"The Steersman is an armoured cruiser built in belter shipyards meant to escort belter trade convoys from increasing pirate threats. The ship sports Poubelle Torpedos along its racks for anti-ship usage while an embrasure for a large weapon mount can be seen on its armoured nose.

A direct evolution from the Helmsman, the Steersman is a more serious take by Belters in creating a functional belter-made warship. Massive rivets dot the ship's hull alluding to the robust belter engineering and an armoured door hangs over the hangar for protection. Despite its firepower and armour, the ship can still falter to pressure from professionally made warships if care is not given in battle.

Hailing from the docks of the Asteroid Central Station, the Steersman represents the Belter's will to be true independents and its ultimate wish to remove piracy within its space. The ship was built to counteract the growing levels of piracy when pirates from the Persean Sector brought ever heavier ships and weapons to raid Belter space.

Its onboard fusion torch is a design derived from the most successful Helmsman homebrewed fusion torch drive nicknamed the Mammoth Fusion Torch. At its core, three Bobcat-Pattern flux reactors power the ship's onboard systems and torch drive.",,,,
rebelrats_xerus,SHIP,"A relatively new addition to the federal cruiser force, Xerus cruisers bear an unusual ABC turret layout, which came as a result of the acquisition requirements submitted by the Federal Design Bureau. In battle, extensive active protection systems abate heavy incoming enemy torpedo fire, increasing survivability not only for itself, but for the unit that it's attached to.

Postings for Xerus cruisers are often envied for their new hulls, spacious interiors, and modern conveniences compatible with Persean devices. While its crew bunks are of average size, hot-bunking is almost are the ship is built with excess crew in mind.  Every soul on board gets their own personal locker and their bunks have some luxury of sound dampening.",,,,
rebelrats_dormouse,SHIP,"Dormouse cruisers were created to solve the supply issue of equipping Provisional Squadrons. These light cruisers bring a good amount of missile coverage into engagements. As they're built from Standard-type modules, interiors are utilitarian, almost spartan in nature. Crews often populate their berths with personal touches to bring a sense of liveness.

Postings for these ships are often disliked by spacers as, while its rooms aren't particularly tight, they are no redeeming qualities either. Berthings are smaller than average, and crews have to share storage space as the personal storage provides only enough space for important belongings. The ship's few redeeming quality are its over-designed galley with ample storage, and updated electronics compatible with Persean systems. ",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_mellivora,SHIP,"Though thin skinned and lightly armed, the Mellivora provides a sufficient amount of strikecraft cover with its high-capacity hangars. During battles, it relies on its blistering speed and ample fighter coverage to strike opponents as its armaments is, at best, comparable to that of a frigate.

Realizing the need for a high mobility light carrier, Krysan High Command commissioned Arms & Armor to design the light carrier as the company possesses the most experience with designing carriers. This resulted in a quick turnover time with the ship's design and development and saw no major issues during its field tests.

With the ship's interiors being relatively new in design with numerous automated systems in place, sleep spaces in the Mellivora offer more privacy and headspace to its crew despite space restrictions. Unfortunately, onboard amenities such as the kitchen galley and commissary had to be reduced to maximize the remaining crewed space in the ship.

The ship is equipped with 4 M505 Fusion Torch Engines and is powered with the latest model flux reactors. Despite the Mellivoraâ€™s size, its onboard hangar facilities are comparatively more spacious for its designed capacity than on bigger Federal Navy ships such as the Marmot and Porcellus, increasing crew comfort during carrier operations.
",,,,
rebelrats_monax_p,SHIP,"Taking advantage of the Monax's commonality, pirates have retrofitted this Monax with snaking munition belts and homebrewed armor plates. What used to be its cargo bay has been replaced by hangar bays and its shuttle bays turned into concealed missile tubes. The extensive upgunning and uparmouring of the hull has earned it the light cruiser classification within Federal Navy records.

While at a glance, two Monax(P)s are seemingly alike, the lack of standardization with the pirate modifications of Monax(P)s means that no two ships are completely the same. One Monax(P) may sport slightly thicker armor while another may be having larger flux batteries as personal requirements differ from one captain to another.

Despite extensive upgrades to the hull, Any pirate captain, experienced enough, knows that the ship is never able to fight peer to peer enemy ships; with its lackluster flux reactor core and jury-rigged shield module, any Monax(P) can easily falter to dedicated enemy fire.
",,,,
rebelrats_rattus,SHIP,"The Rattus is an ancient design that predates the Krysan Federal Navy. Outdated, the design would be given a deep upgrade package by Rebel Rats, giving the ship updated subsystems and brand new Arms & Armor railguns. This upgrade would allow the Rattus fighting toe to toe against Persean Sector ships, predominantly during the First Contact Scuffle where misunderstandings between the Krysans and the Hegemony would lead to a brief conflict.

The Rattus was instrumental during Penance Day when disillusioned captains and nobles led a massive rebellion against the Krysan Empire. The conflict would last 8 long years and culminate in the dissolution of the Krysan Empire and the formation of the Federated States of Krysa. During the rebellion, it would slowly become a symbol of heroes, adventure and freedom among the youth and young captains.

Following the principles of thrust-gravity oriented design, the Rattus has a narrow hull with a vertical layout, leading to a smaller front cross section that allows Rattus captains to minimize the chances of the enemy landing a hit, though to the disdain of crewmembers needing to navigate up and down the shipâ€™s tight vertical spaces with steep ladders.
",,,,
rebelrats_helmsman,SHIP,"Despite its makeshift appearance, the Helmsmanâ€™s barebones design gives it outstanding agility with its outrigged RCS thrusters. Its onboard shield generator was ripped off of a salvaged Monax cargo ship and tuned to the size of the Helmsman. Despite this, the ship is adequately armed for its size but canâ€™t handle similarly sized ships that have proper flux cores installed.

With captains that can only be described as desperate daredevils with no regard for their own indemnity, the Helmsman can be manually constructed in the hands of any person desperate enough with the wanderlust for star travel or piracy. Its interior spaces are cramped and reminiscent of ancient planetary submersibles with parts of the crew sleeping in cramped bunks with very little headroom or privacy. 

Its fusion torch engine is homebrewed from a frankenstein of parts while its flux reactor is usually a Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor taken from a salvaged Monax.
",,,,
rebelrats_sorex,SHIP,"Considered unconventional in Krysan Admiralty for its lack of missile mounts, nevertheless, the Sorex is a capable destroyer with respectable forward firepower. They are often paired with another ship to make up for its lackluster point defence grid so that it can focus on anti-ship duties. The ship's autoloaders ensures that its weapons will engage at the max rate of fire. Its respectable level of protection will let it weather through scuffles.

Despite being overshadowed by the Rattus for its unwieldiness and its late introduction just after the Penance War, the Sorex has a reputation for being a comfortable ship by its crews as it has been designed around crew ergonomics. The ship was expected to perform long duration patrols or intermittent deep space anti-piracy missions. 

Unlike the Rattus, Sorex crews enjoy roomier and more modern accommodations with several quality of life measures taken for crew comfort, making it popular for captains who seek to enjoy picket duty in comfort. Its onboard galley is regarded to be like a hotel with its homely decorations and lighting acting as a third place for crew to get together in their free time.",,,,
rebelrats_tamias,SHIP,"A simple destroyer designed by Kaharian Naval Steelworks with modularity in mind, Standard-type modules made the Tamias easy to build on demand. Pairing its appreciable weapon set with a large hull, the Tamias can afford to stay out on patrols longer while being able to deal with most pirate threats. During fleet action, Tamias destroyers support fleets with its set of APS missiles and secondary fire support.

During the build up of Provisional Squadrons, the Federal Navy found itself far short of modern ships to supply to the newly formed garrisons. To make up for the shortage, it enlisted the expertise of Kaharian Naval Steelworks. The Standard-type system was born. it consisted of forge built segments which had universal connectors for easy construction.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_mus,SHIP,"Bearing unparalleled speed and brash firepower, the Mus is a menace on the battlefield when left unattended. The shipâ€™s built-in plasma launchers and torpedo tubes allow it to spar with larger ships while its new S601 Fusion Torch gives it the speed to easily keep up with enemy frigates. However, this emphasis on movement meant that armor had to be sacrificed, leaivng the Mus with paper thin armor.

Rebel Rat Industries created the Mus to serve alongside the Rattus as its escort. As the newest addition to the Krysan Federal Navy, the Mus enjoys better shield generators that are more efficient at taking shots and provides wider coverage than older shield models.

Despite being a recent addition, the Mus quickly became a common sight along Krysan trade routes as a pursuit ship against any roving pirate ship.
",,,,
rebelrats_patron,SHIP,"A corvette built to provide PD coverage for warships, the Patron uses its bow mounted Felis LAWS to quickly sweep through fighter formations. Ironically, due to its diminutive size, the Patron is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by fighters due to the Felis LAWSâ€™ limited firing arc.

Created by Arms & Armor, there was no expenses spared in the creation of the Patron. The interior has been carefully modelled to house the 4-man cockpit crew as comfortably as possible. The designers included a dedicated galley for the crew, which, as small as it is, goes a long way during long voyages for crew comfort. Unfortunately, its small size meant that the vessel has little in the way of protection, being comparable to armoured fighter craft.

The corvette is one of the few deep space capable ships that still maintains older-type fusion engines, that being two XS801 Pion Pulse Fusion Engines. The shipâ€™s energy is maintained by a side mounted Minuitoid-Pattern flux reactor, a fairly recent development in the miniaturization of Flux Reactor technology.
",,,,
rebelrats_musrattus,SHIP,"An experimental ship designed to maximize elements of the Mobile Defence Doctrine, the Mus Rattus is an advanced frigate built around a small Doldrums Railgun and bleeding edge fusion drive tech. Recent advances in the miniaturization of Krysan technology allowed its designers to fit all the necessary components to fire the Doldrums without needing to shut down subsystems.

Despite miniaturization of ship technologies and subsystems, sacrifices had to be made as evident by the ship's cramped accommodations and amenities. This means that the ship has to be flown together with larger spacious ships during long-term deployments to sustain ship operations.",,,,
,,,,,,
#LOGISTICS SHIPS,,,,,,
rebelrats_pybara,SHIP,"The penultimate cargo carrier of the Naval Logistics Fleet, the Pybara's built around the relatively new Super Heavy Containers to satisfy the increasing needs of Krysan Federal Navy. Uniquely, its size can be attributed to the hull being designed around a Daedalus-type fusion torch that utilizes features inspired by acquired Persean Sector technology.

Developed in conjuction with the Fleet Logistics Improvement Program, the Three Brothers Corporation was tasked with the designing of a new heavy logistics ship based on the newly developed Super Heavy Containers that was supposed to speed up cargo turnover times. While the project was successful, the limited amount of docks that can accommodate the new line of ships and its rarer Daedalus-type engine prevented the Pybara from becoming the new system standard for fleet cargo carriers.

Despite unfortunate shortcomings, Pybara captains and crew enjoy more spacious accommodations than the smaller Monax thanks to extensive automation and additional onboard facilities its fighter detachment. Pybaras feature a couple of people mover cars along its spines to quickly shunt people and materials around to the delight of onboard off-duty crew and pilots.

At its core, the Pybara hosts a single Camel-Pattern Flux Reactor to power the large H101D Daedalus-type Fusion Torch while two Minuitoid Flux Reactors are responsible for powering the ship's various subsystems.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_monax,SHIP,"The Monax is the workhorse of the Naval Logistics Fleet with its ample cargo holds and extensive salvaging equipment. Nothing on the shipâ€™s base model is underutilized or an embellishment, every part of the Monax is designed to be easily interchangeable to fit the userâ€™s needs while its cargo holds have been maximized to carry as many cargo units as possible with its powerful torch drive. 

The freighter is a collaboration between Kaharian Naval Steelworks and Jerelâ€™s Fuel Haulers, now called the Three Brother's Corporation after merging, in an attempt to standardize Krysan cargo hauling. The project, being hugely successful, made the Monax the most common freighter to be seen flying in Krysan trade fleets. The Monaxâ€™ ubiquity and focus in standardization in Krysan cargo fleets created a barter economy that revolved around trading parts and also allowed dedicated businesses that are solely created for servicing Monax freighters.

The ship is equipped with an M405 Torch Drive that has been factory tuned for maximum efficiency and is hooked up to a single Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor.

rebelrats_panya,SHIP,"Despite its size, the Panya is more than capable of supporting local economies and small commerce fleets. Due to this, Federal Navy officers took interest in the ship's potential to extend the deep space endurance of flotillas as the ship was essentially nothing more than a few modular cargo holds with a fusion torch attached on its back. Like the Persean Sector's Buffalo, the Panya relies on escorts to carry it through its journeys safely.

The ship found its origins as a cheap solution to solving the shortage of service shuttles large enough to meet the growing demands of station constellations in Dragon's Blessing. Overtime, the Panya was able to grow out a niche of being the first choice for upcoming Krysan starfarers looking for a cheap cargo ship that demanded little maintenance.

With its diminutive size, the Panya's interiors can only be described as utilitarian and more akin to that of terrestrial cargo ships with individual cabins to host its measly number of crew. Fortunately for the crew, the ship utilizes extensive automation to ease the level of workload, meaning that onboard accommodations are more spacious than its larger brothers.

The ship is equipped with a Lynx-pattern flux reactor to power its systems and a single M303 Fusion Torch tuned down for efficiency.",,,,
rebelrats_rott,SHIP,"The Rott is a humble fuel tanker that can be compared to the Persean Sector's Dram. The Rott has enough fuel in its tanks to double the fuel range of a Federal navy flotilla. As such, the ship is often seen paired together with Panyas or other cargo haulers to extend the range of Krysan Expeditions.

The ship was initially conceived by The Three Brothers Corporation as a way to address the lack of standardization within the grassroots level of Krysan space economy. With its barebones structure and open truss structure, the Rott can easily be configured by any captain to their taste without the need for specialized tools.

Like the Panya, the interior of the Rott is utilitarian with little luxuries to speak of. Although, with onboard automation, Rott crews can expect at least a modicum of comfort as indicated by spaceworthy assurance laws with onboard accommodations created using mass-produced ""Unit Rooms"". This meant entire rooms can be easily renovated or replaced, assuring Rott captains that their ship accommodations can be easily updated.

The ship runs with a Lynx-Pattern flux reactor to power and systems while a pellet-fed DAEDALUS-type engine ensures efficient fuel consumption. ",,,,

The Krysan Federal Navy is the naval arm of the Federated States of Krysa and responsible for enforcing and safeguarding the nation's celestial borders and citizens within the sector.

The Federated States of Krysa is a burgeoning polity governed by a directorial assembly who jointly serve as the collective head of state. This polity was formed from the defunct Krysan Empire, after a long interplanetary civil war called the Penance War which led to the devastation of much of the nation's infrastructure.

It is not known whether the nation is Domain in origin as no records of past colonization efforts that exists within Hegemony libraries. Nevertheless, it is clear to the sector that the nationstate has poised itself to be independent of the Hegemony; with a Krysan spokesperson outwardly stating the nation's desire to be neither friend or foe of the Hegemony.

Despite the its apparent unity against hostile foreign powers, the nation is not without problems as growing rebel cells left over from its civil war persist and engage in sporadic armed conflict against Krysan Navy elements. The problem is especially evident within the Tikus system where an influx of Persean Sector pirates have lumped themselves together with rebel cells in hopes of a quick buck. Worse is the growing influence of Tri-Tachyon over the nation's outer colonies and mounting evidence of the Persean League conspiring with pirate captains to cause trade disruptions and create headaches for Krysan officials.

Regardless of its problems, the Federated States of Krysa remain stalwart and lustrous against the decaying Persean Sector, with the nation perching itself optimistic for the prospect of further cooperation with the Hegemony despite its uneasy relationship. 

Most importantly, instilled within every citizen is the nation's often heard motto:

""In the will of the gods, we fervently live.""

#PLANETS,,,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_planet,CUSTOM,"The planet serves as an example of the nationâ€™s conviction to its founding tenets, manifesting itself in the people's ability to heal the planet's grievous wounds earned from its long history of conflict.

Today, Krysa presents itself to the sector as one of the most prosperous places to visit, bearing natural features similar to that of Old Earth despite nearly turning into an arid hellscape more than half a century earlier. Upon closer inspection, scars of past conflicts can be seen from orbit with huge craters long filled by surrounding fauna.",,,,
rebelrats_malus_planet,CUSTOM,"Lawless is the word that encompasses Malus. Despite its arid wastelands, settlements huddle around the planet's few remaining water sources, ranging from hastily made shanty towns huddling around ailing lakes, to relatively well-built hab towns centered around vast underground water stores. Whatever authority around here is largely self-imposed through the use of force and shady backroom deals.

Its history goes far back into the days of the Penance War when rebels used Malus as a smuggling port to hide from the Empire. After the Penance War, disrguntled rebels and undesirables acquisitioned the numerous decommissioned military installations and built them up to the settlements that are seen today.
",,,,
rebelrats_magawa_moon,CUSTOM,"Gigantic orbital berths orbiting around the planet dutifully service civilian freighters who have arrived to have their holds tended to. Magawan defence stations are seen in the horizon, ponderously hovering as a grim reminder of the planetâ€™s history of living through multiple bombardments.

Despite scarred looks gained from decades of conflict, Magawa hosts one of the largest subterranean complexes of cities fortresses in the sector. These underground megastructures were built during the Penance War from a vast network of old mining tunnels. Today, many of the surface emplacements have been converted for civilian use, with the largest ones developing into hubs for huge dome cities.
",,,,
rebelrats_rodentia_planet,CUSTOM,"The humble green giant has been the source of many Krysan folk tales and superstitions, often cited by olden folks to be where gods reside with their mountains of emerald riches. However, in contrast, children often joke that the gas giant's vivid hue is a result of the sheer amount of rat flatulence.

Today, Rodentia is home to the largest orbital refineries of Krysa, fuelling the armadas of the Federal Navy and housing the berths of the Krysan Federal Auxiliary Corps. Around the planet, trade fleets can be observed using the green giantâ€™s immense gravity to save fuel via slingshots, providing a beautiful demonstration of graceful gravitational manoeuvres akin to that of old Earth.",,,,
rebelrats_nutria_planet,CUSTOM,"Amusingly referred to as the system's supermarket, Nutria is home to the largest settlement of independent traders second only to the Asteroid Central Station. The city of Spalax can be seen with its concourse of markets spanning the breadth of the city next to its equally gigantic space port that accommodates the flow of trade between Krysa and the rest of the Persean Sector.
",,,,
rebelrats_tikus_gasGiant,CUSTOM,"Like Rodentia, Tikus I has orbital refineries dotted across its orbit that routinely send out mining teams to extract its precious gas. The gas giant is the beating heart of the system's economy, providing the necessary fuel for interstellar return trips and as a constant source of jobs for its inhabitants. In the future, Tikus I is expected to overtake Rodentia as the nation's main source of fuel.",,,,
rebelrats_tikusII_planet,CUSTOM,"With relatively mild climates, rich ore, and crop compatible soils, Tikus II was a prime target for Krysan colonisation efforts. While Tikus II can be described as a jungle planet, it is far from it hosting a single homogenous biome. Peeling through the layers, Tikus II has a complex system of biomes with equatorial regions hosting the densest concentrations of flora and fauna while its highest peaks are just barely breathable for individuals due to the planet's thick atmosphere.",,,,
rebelrats_tikusIII_planet,CUSTOM,"Tikus III, despite its almost destitute geography, is host to numerous independent settlements that popped up during Krysan colonisation efforts. What few settlements found on the planet huddle themselves around systems of natural caves and tunnels that provide the few places that settlers can actively grow organic food such as mushrooms and low-light demanding crops as some form of sustenance.

Outside of what little of its exotic crops can be exported, settlers also take to mining the pockets of gas to send it out to be refined on Tikus I as an external source of credits for the planet's meagre economy.",,,,

rebelrats_outerstation,CUSTOM,"A station made of asteroids cobbled together, Asteroid Central Station is the home port for the many miners, and smugglers, in the system. The massive station was once a humble outpost owned by a now defunct mining company and was later rapidly expanded out of necessity as numerous refugees fllocked to the outpost during the Penance Civil War.

Despite its ponderous appearance, the station is lightly-armed with very few large guns to speak of. The few dedicated defence modules that can be seen are a handful of jury-rigged gun platforms not too dissimilar to those found on Pirate or Pather stations.
