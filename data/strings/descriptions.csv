#SHIP WEAPONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_equalizer_l,WEAPON,"The Equalizer's ponderous shots can shatter even the thickest armor plates. Its origins are as old as the Krysan Federal Monarchy, with it seeing first use in the defence of Magawa from loyalist elements.",,,,
rebelrats_doldrums_l,WEAPON,"The Doldrums-Pattern railgun is the most capable weapon in the Khrysan Navy arsenal, firing devastating AM-tipped warheads. The Federal Navy built the Doldrums during Krysan Orbital Defence Program but later retooled the railgun to install them on Krysan Cruisers and Battleships as per the new Mobile Defence Doctrine.",Does this show up?,,,
rebelrats_drummer_l,WEAPON,The Drummer is an offshoot development of the Doldrums-Pattern railgun family. It utilizes an electrothermal-chemical firing system and gauss coils to fire inert rods against enemy shields,,,,
rebelrats_tripubus_l,WEAPON,"Unimaginative, but effective, the Tripubus is the Siege Harquebus' bigger brother. Despite sporting smaller shells than the Equalizer, the Tripubus has a heavier throw weight and more potential damage. Will be reliable against all but the thickest armor plates.",,,,
rebelrats_goedendag_l,WEAPON,"Buried behind the stealth composite plating is a complex series of carefully engineered electromagnets, capacitors, and extensive cooling equipment snaking around a set of magazines connected to the ship’s internal ammo forges. The Goedendag railgun is built to give the Jerboa the firepower to square off with its peers if its onboard missiles aren’t sufficient.",,,,
rebelrats_mangonel_l,WEAPON,"At its core, the Mangonel is a reverse engineered TPC from a wrecked Onslaught. Installing larger capacitors, The Three Brothers Corporation magnified the damage beyond what the original TPC was designed for. Despite its ability to inflict horrific damage on enemy ships, the Mangonel has seen limited service in the Krysan Fleet due to its costly flux requirements.",,,,
rebelrats_nezulana_l,WEAPON,"A railgun designed by the rebel rats in order to break capital-grade shields. Following the success of the Drummer, the Nezulana utilizes a scaled-up version of the same electrothermal-chemical launch system to hurl saboted hyperdense penetrating rods at enemy shields.",,,,

rebelrats_custodian_m,WEAPON,The Custodian brings the much needed capability to bring down multiple targets with a single shot. Its built-in autoloader ensures that the gun is quickly fed flak shells during battle.,,,,
rebelrats_muridae_m,WEAPON,"Created by The Three Brothers Corporation and leased to Rebel Rat Industries, the launcher fires hyper-charged plasma bolts that melt through armour and hull. However, its downside is its relatively high flux requirements and its tendency to overheat that limits its capabilities.",,,,
rebelrats_arratoi_m,WEAPON,These are powerful railguns that fire standard issue anti-shield rounds. The Arratoi were developed for the Rattus Modernization Project to augment the firepower of the Rattus against increasingly hardy spacecraft shields.,,,,
rebelrats_petard_m,WEAPON,"Using laser activated nuclear pellets in a reinforced chamber, the Petard is a terrifying weapon to be struck by. Barrel Rectifiers would guide the released energy into a concentrated beam as it exits the gun and produce horrific results if the hull is directly struck, working similar to that of Krysan Pest Control equipment.",,,,
rebelrats_braggador_m,WEAPON,"Created to bridge the gap between long ranged flak and smaller short ranged PD, the Braggador’s quad guns can easily shoot down enemy torpedoes or blunt incoming enemy bomber runs.",,,,
rebelrats_rattenjager_m,WEAPON,The Rattenjager utilizes advanced algorithms and a smart-fuze system to intercept fighters and missiles. An integrated ammo feeder in the turret mount allows the weapon to be constantly fed with new missiles during battle. ,,,,
rebelrats_rattenjager_array_m,WEAPON,A built-in array of Snapper Hardkill APS for long-range interceptions,,,,
rebelrats_petardlauncher_m,WEAPON,"Seeing that the Petard conveniently came in ready-to-use canisters, it didn't take long for someone to mount thrusters and a guidance system to make a rudimentary, but effective, DEM",,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_salvo,WEAPON,Triple rack for Huntsman Torpedos,,,,
,,,,,,
#MUS HUNTSMAN AUTOLOADER,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsmanx2_m,WEAPON,These torpedo tubes serve as the Mus' main anti-ship weapon to allow the Mus to punch above its weight class. The tubes utilizes an autoloader derived from the Rattus that ensures a quick rate of fire.,,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_s,WEAPON,"Ubiquitous on Krysan Navy ships, the Huntsman is a guided torpedo designed similarly to the Persean Sector's Harpoons. The Huntsman's AM-catalysed plasma warhead allow it to punch through contemporary armor plates.",,,,
rebelrats_hwacha_s,WEAPON,"The Hwacha SRM takes inspiration from the Swarmer SRM, dutifully fulfilling atmospheric and non-atmospheric anti-fighter craft roles with high agility. ",,,,

rebelrats_culverin,WEAPON,"A simple weapon, the Culverin is the standard issue high-explosive light anti-ship weapon for the Krysan Navy. Its two internal magazines let it fire HE shells in rapid bursts.",,,,
rebelrats_longbow,WEAPON,"The Longbow is the standard issue light anti-shield weapon for the Krysan Navy. It fires small inert rounds that are relatively effective against enemy shields, especially against frigates that have a smaller flux capacity.",,,,
rebelrats_huntsmanx2,WEAPON,Dual rack for the Huntsman Torpedo,,,,
rebelrats_hawker,WEAPON,The Hawker is a pirate's favorite. It utilizes time-fuzed canister shells to quickly bring down incoming groups of missiles without the need of complex guidance systems,,,,
rebelrats_pyroclast,WEAPON,The Pyroclast is the Federal Navy's answer to the Reaper. It uses a hypercharged AM-shaped charge warhead that has armour penetration values measured in kilometers to allow it to break through heavy ship armor.,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_torp,WEAPON,A missile autoloader that has been fitted into the ship's center weapons module to quickly reload Huntsman torpedoes. ,,,,
rebelrats_ashford,WEAPON,The Ashford is comparable to Persean Sector PD lasers with its signature variable lense that allows it to have a higher effective range than other Krysan PD weapons. ,,,,
rebelrats_poacher_s,WEAPON,"Favoring accuracy by volume like ancient CIWS designs, the Poacher was an anti-ship weapon that was handed PD duties. The turret's APIT shells coupled with an astounding rate of fire allows it to shred through destroyer-grade armor plating quickly when enmassed.",,,,
rebelrats_poubelle,WEAPON,Less of a proper missile and more of a propelled IED cobbled from off-the-shelf civilian guidance components. The lack of a complex thruster system has left plenty of room to stuff a far larger payload to compensate for the low-grade explosives used in civilian mining charges.,,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTER WEAPONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_f,WEAPON,"A fighter-mounted version of the Huntsman Torpedo stowed under the fuselage due to its size. The fighter's weight restrictions downsized the torpedo's warhead, but will still be sufficient to threaten ships, especially those with thin armor.",,,,
rebelrats_ranger_f,WEAPON,"A stripped-down version of the Ranger, the cannon has a decreased fire rate for better heat management and less velocity per shell to limit vibrations in the fighter's chassis.",,,,
rebelrats_hwacha_f,WEAPON,"Modified for fighter use, Hwachas have proven to be effective for fighters due to its speed and agility, so the weapon sees mass use throughout Krysan strike craft.",,,,
rebelrats_guardsman_f,WEAPON,Guardsman-Pattern turrets have their roots in old Krysan naval ship armaments as CIWS installations. They are the mainstay armaments of Hippo Skiffs and bombers due to their ubiquity and ability to function with minimal maintenance.,,,,
rebelrats_vaybchek,WEAPON,"Overcharged plasma mining tools, the Vaybchek purposefully overloads its mining cartridges to produce a higher output. This unsafe practice commonly led to premature breech explosions when done wrong, often injuring the crew.",,,,
rebelrats_pyroclast_f,WEAPON,"Removing the complex thruster system and fitted with a solid rocket motor, this version of the Pyroclast is meant to be fitted into the Olympian's magnetic bomb launcher.",,,,
rebelrats_felis,WEAPON,Built-in PD laser created for the Patron corvette. Extremely effective against fighters and missiles despite its high flux costs.,,,,
rebelrats_ashford_f,WEAPON,A tuned down Ashford for fighter use.,,,,

rebelrats_falcon_f,WEAPON,A wing mounting bracket for falcons.,,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTERS,,,,,,
rebelrats_sultan,SHIP,"The Sultan is the Krysan Navy's premier fighter. It was built and designed by Rebel Rats to operate both in atmosphere and space, acting as a multi-role SSTO fighter. Its large arsenal of weapons is enough to deal with most enemies in battle space, especially with its underslung Huntsman torpedo to help it hunt larger spacecraft.",,,,
rebelrats_proctor,SHIP,"More of an engine than a fighter, the Proctor was created to counter the growing number of pirates in the Persean Sector. Its armaments allow it to hunt frigates, but it quickly falters against concentrated enemy PD fire with its lack of shields despite extensive armoring around crucial internal systems.",,,,
rebelrats_hippo,SHIP,"The Hippo is the standard-issue skiff of Krysan Federal Navy warships. They allow Krysan Ships to insert a platoon of marines into a planetary battlespace or initiate boarding action agaisnt enemy ships and stations with breaching charges. Outside of dropship duties, the skiffs can act as impromptu PD boats to screen its mothership with its Guardsman turrets.",,,,
rebelrats_overseer,SHIP,"A light interceptor of the Krysan Federal Navy, the Overseer is a hardy fighter created by Arms & Armor. The craft comes equipped with a Hwacha missile rack and a pair of Ranger autocannons, making a wing of Overseers a threat to enemy shields.",,,,
rebelrats_ministro,SHIP,"The Ministro is a lightweight, unmanned interceptor drone designed by Rebel Rat Industries as a proposal to Krysan Navy officials to reduce pilot losses. It quickly found success with increasingly advanced drone control systems that allowed finer control with unmanned drones.",,,,
rebelrats_patron_f,SHIP,"Cleverly set up microforges have allowed Federal ships to stuff an entire corvette into a hangar bay. Unfortunately, this means that only one Patron can be deployed per hangar bay with reduced capabilities.",,,,
rebelrats_daekon,SHIP,A fast assault fighter built to break the shields of the enemy spacecraft and shred their armor with assault chainguns.,,,,
rebelrats_dustero,SHIP,lol haha im talon but i got guardsman turrets. better fear me,,,,
,,,,,,
#BOMBERS,,,,,,
rebelrats_olympian,SHIP,"Despite its shambolic origins of being made from the remains of Piranha bombers, the Olympian is a capable bomber that dutifully does its job with more than enough armor and PD coverage to last it through its bombing run. A recurring joke among Olympian pilots is that the onboard warhead contains a Red Bombardier Rat as its payload.",,,,"""What kind of barbarians would ever use an animal as its guidance system? That's preposterous!"""
rebelrats_bluster,SHIP,The Bluster has its origins from juryrigged shuttlecraft in mining fleets around Asteroid Central Station who looked for a temporary solution to the growing pirate problem. A salvaged guardsman turret sits on top of the Bluster's engine block to serve as all around protection against enemy fightercraft.,,,,
,,,,,,
#COMBAT SHIPS ,,,,,,
rebelrats_porcellus,SHIP,"Bristling with weaponry and cladded in thick composites, the Porcellus is the most common capital ship found in Krysan Federal Navy battlegroups. In the ship's hangars, the Porcellus carries a pair of skiffs that can conduct rapid military insertions, or act as PD screens during engagements.

The Porcellus is designed by the Arms and Armor Conglomerate and is built in the massive orbital berths of Kaharian Naval Steelworks. Being based off of a venerable design in the days of the Empire, the prototype model initially lacked effective PD coverage and long-ranged weaponry, but improvements to PD designs and new technologies brought by the development of the Mobile Defence Doctrine made the Porcellus one of the safest ships in the Krysan Federal Navy.

At the ship’s core, four Barkley-Pattern Heavy-Duty AM-catalysed flux reactors are responsible for powering the ship’s Basilica-Model shield generator and its set of four massive H303 Torch Drives and two secondary H302 Torch Drives.
",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_marmot,SHIP,"Marmot Heavy Cruisers form the backbone of Krysan formations. The ship’s set of weapon mounts and hangars means that the ship can fill most roles that its captain may require. With its Doldrums Superheavy Railgun, the Marmot allows captains to bring station-grade weaponry to battles, allowing the ship to act as fire support for larger capitals.

Designed by Veronica Witherfield, Rebel Rats Head Engineer, the Marmot is designed to fill out a multitude of roles in the field from squadron leader in flotillas, to fire support platforms in larger battles. Veronica, together with Federal Navy officers, created the ship alongside the Mobile Defence Doctrine, giving the ship with sufficient structural integrity and flux systems to handle the operation of a Doldrums Superheavy Railgun.

The ship became notable during its first major use in the Siege of Nutria against pirate ships from the Persean Sector. Using the Doldrums, flotillas of Marmots were able to lift the siege and chase the fleeing pirates back to the jump point with minimal losses. The battle would prove the ship's capabilities to Krysan High Command as an effective fire support vehicle for capitals.

Equipped with two M405 Torch Drives, the Marmot can easily manoeuvre around the battlefield to take advantage of opportunities. For power, the ship uses two Barkley-Pattern Heavy-duty AM-catalysed flux reactors that power the ship’s torch drives and dual shield generators.
",,,,
rebelrats_jerboa,SHIP,"The Jerboa is the Federal Navy’s stealth cruiser. It employs redundant layers of stealth composites reduce sensor profile to conduct covert special operations. However, for the occasional ship-to-ship engagements, its Goedendag railgun provide the necessary firepower to duel enemy ships brave enough to spar with the ship.

Built by The Three Brothers Corporation, the Jerboa is the main warship of the Krysan Special Operations Command and is commonly used in commerce raiding and special recon missions. Apart from the Goedendag Railgun, the Jerboa is equipped with modular mounts and a small hangar bay that can be modified to suit the needs of the given mission.

The ship uses two heavily modified M503 Torch Drives fed by three Sleipnir-Pattern Hyper Cooled flux reactors. Apart from its use of stealth composites, the Jerboa also runs extensive hull cooling systems to hide it in the infrared spectrum, often storing waste heat in its 2 massive internal heat sinks that recycle the heat to power auxiliary systems until the ship can dump it out safely out of prying eyes.
",,,,
rebelrats_matkaboska,SHIP,"Despite lacking the mountings for a Doldrums, the Matka Boska makes up for it with copious amounts of firepower and armor. The ship has a solid reputation for keeping its crew safe during heavy engagements thanks to its armor layout. Due to this apparent hardiness, the ship has become a favorite for officers to use as frontline command ships.

The Matka Boska was unfortunately conceived right before the culmination of the Mobile Defence Doctrine development. Due to this, the ship received neither suffiecient mountings nor sufficient reactors to accommodate the energy need of a Doldrums. Instead, the ship relies on thick slabs of frontal ablative armour and an arsenal of missiles to even out peer to peer fights.

The base design of the ship predates that of the Marmot and resembles that of archaic Krysan warships as Rebel Rat engineers took design cues from warships of old. Due to this, the Matka Boska not only boasts heavier armour than its contemporaries, but also better structural integrity and hardier citadels to keep its crew safe during engagements.

The ship is equipped with two Barkley-Pattern AM-catalysed flux reactors to power its singular H305 Torch Drive and its Basilica-Model shield generator. Multiple redundant subsystems are in place to make sure that the ship can get the crew back to safety including extensive escape skiff bays.
",,,,
rebelrats_steersman,SHIP,"The Steersman is an armored cruiser built in belter shipyards meant to escort belter trade convoys from increasing pirate threats. On its truss, the ship sports racks of Poubelle Torpedos for anti-ship usage while an embrasure for its large weapon mount can be seen on its nose, hidden behind layers of armor plates.

A direct evolution from the Helmsman, the Steersman is a more serious take by Belters in creating a functional belter-made warship. Massive rivets dot the ship's hull to announce the ship's armored status and an armoured retractable armored door hangs over the hangar for protection. Despite this, the ship can still falter to pressure from professionally made warships if care is not given in battle.

Hailing from the docks of the Asteroid Central Station, the Steersman represents the Belter's will to be independents and its ultimate wish to remove piracy within its jurisdiction. The ship was made to counteract the growing levels of piracy as pirates coming from the Persean Sector bring ever more heavier ships and weapons to raid Belter space.

Its onboard fusion torch is a design derived from the most successful Helmsman homebrewed fusion torch drive named the Mammoth Fusion Torch. At its core, three Bobcat-Pattern flux reactors power the ship's onboard systems and torch drive.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_mellivora,SHIP,"Though thin skinned and lightly armed, the Mellivora can provide sufficient strikecraft cover with its high-capacity hangars. During battles, it relies on its blistering speed and ample fighter coverage to strike opponents as its armaments is, at best, comparable to that of a frigate.

Realizing the need for a high mobility light carrier, Krysan High Command commissioned Arms & Armor to design the light carrier as the company possesses most experience with designing carriers. This resulted in a quick turnover time with the ship's design and development and saw no major issues during its field tests.

With the ship's interiors being relatively new in design with numerous automated systems in place, sleep spaces in the Mellivora offer more privacy and headspace to its crew despite space restrictions. Unfortunately, onboard amenities such as the kitchen galley and commissary had to be reduced to maximize the remaining crewed space in the ship.

The ship is equipped with 4 M505 Fusion Torch Engines and is powered with the latest model flux reactors. Despite the Mellivora’s size, its onboard hangar facilities are comparatively more spacious for its designed capacity than on bigger Federal Navy ships such as the Marmot and Porcellus, increasing crew comfort during carrier operations.
",,,,
rebelrats_monax_p,SHIP,"Taking advantage of the Monax's commonality, pirates have retrofitted it with snaking munition belts and homebrewed armor plates. What used to be its cargo bay has been replaced by hangar bays and its shuttle bays turned into concealed missile tubes. The extensive upgunning and uparmouring of the hull has earned it the light cruiser classification within Federal Navy records.

While at a glance, two Monax(P)s are seemingly alike, the lack of standardization with the pirate modifications of Monax(P)s means that no two ships are completely the same. One ship may sport slightly thicker armor while another may be having larger flux batteries as requirements differ from one captain to another.

Despite extensive upgrades to the hull, Any pirate captain, experienced enough, knows that the ship is never able to fight peer to peer enemy ships; with its lackluster flux reactor core and jury-rigged shield module, any Monax(P) can easily falter to dedicated enemy fire.
",,,,
rebelrats_rattus,SHIP,"The Rattus is an ancient design that predates the Krysan Federal Navy. Outdated, the design would be given a deep upgrade package by Rebel Rats, giving the ship updated subsystems and brand new Arms & Armor railguns. This upgrade would allow the Rattus fighting toe to toe against Persean Sector ships, predominantly during the First Contact Scuffle where misunderstandings between the Krysans and the Hegemony would lead to a brief conflict.

The Rattus was instrumental during Penance Day when disillusioned captains and nobles led a massive rebellion against the Krysan Empire. The conflict would last 8 long years and culminate in the dissolution of the Krysan Empire and the formation of the Federated States of Krysa. During the rebellion, it would slowly become a symbol of heroes, adventure and freedom among the youth.

Following the principles of thrust-gravity oriented design, the Rattus has a narrow hull with a vertical layout, leading to a smaller front cross section that allows Rattus captains to minimize the chances of the enemy landing a hit, though to the disdain of crewmembers needing to navigate up and down the ship’s tight vertical spaces with steep ladders.
",,,,
rebelrats_helmsman,SHIP,"Despite its makeshift appearance, the Helmsman’s barebones design gives it outstanding agility with its outrigged RCS thrusters. Its onboard shield generator was ripped off of a salvaged Monax cargo ship and tuned to the size of the Helmsman. Despite this, the ship is adequately armed for its size but can’t handle similarly sized ships that have proper flux cores installed.

With captains that can only be described as desperate daredevils with no regard for their own indemnity, the Helmsman can be manually constructed in the hands of any person desperate enough with the wanderlust for star travel or piracy. Its interior spaces are cramped and reminiscent of ancient planetary submersibles with parts of the crew sleeping in cramped bunks with very little headroom or privacy. 

Its fusion torch engine is homebrewed from a frankenstein of parts while its flux reactor is usually a Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor taken from a salvaged Monax.
",,,,
rebelrats_sorex,SHIP,Im a gunship and u should fear me,,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_mus,SHIP,"Bearing unparalleled speed and brash firepower, the Mus is a menace on the battlefield when left unattended. The ship’s built-in plasma launchers and torpedo tubes allow it to spar with larger ships while its new S601 Fusion Torch gives it the speed to easily keep up with enemy frigates. However, this emphasis on movement meant that armor had to be sacrificed, leaivng the Mus with paper thin armor.

Rebel Rat Industries created the Mus to serve alongside the Rattus as its escort. As the newest addition to the Krysan Federal Navy, the Mus enjoys better shield generators that are more efficient at taking shots and provides wider coverage than older shield models.

Despite being a recent addition, the Mus quickly became a common sight along Krysan trade routes as a pursuit ship against any roving pirate ship.
",,,,
rebelrats_patron,SHIP,"A corvette built to provide PD coverage for warships, the Patron uses its bow mounted Felis LAWS to quickly sweep through fighter formations. Ironically, due to its diminutive size, the Patron is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by fighters due to the Felis LAWS’ limited firing arc.

Created by Arms & Armor, there was no expenses spared in the creation of the Patron. The interior has been carefully modelled to house the 4-man cockpit crew as comfortably as possible. The designers included a dedicated galley for the crew, which, as small as it is, goes a long way during long voyages for crew comfort. Unfortunately, its small size meant that the vessel has little in the way of protection, being comparable to armoured fighter craft.

The corvette is one of the few deep space capable ships that still maintains older-type fusion engines, that being two XS801 Pion Pulse Fusion Engines. The ship’s energy is maintained by a side mounted Minuitoid-Pattern flux reactor, a fairly recent development in the miniaturization of Flux Reactor technology.
",,,,
rebelrats_musrattus,SHIP,"An experimental ship designed to maximize elements of the Mobile Defence Doctrine, the Mus Rattus is an advanced frigate built around a small Doldrums Railgun and bleeding edge fusion drive tech. Recent advances in the miniaturization of Krysan technology allowed its designers to fit all the necessary components to fire the Doldrums without needing to shut down subsystems.

Despite miniaturization of ship technologies and subsystems, sacrifices had to be made as evident by the ship's cramped accommodations and amenities. This means that the ship has to be flown together with larger spacious ships during long-term deployments to sustain ship operations.",,,,
,,,,,,
#LOGISTICS SHIPS,,,,,,
rebelrats_pybara,SHIP,"The penultimate cargo carrier of the Naval Logistics Fleet, the Pybara's built around the relatively new Super Heavy Containers to satisfy the increasing needs of Krysan Federal Navy. Uniquely, its size can be attributed to the hull being designed around a Daedalus-type fusion torch that utilizes features inspired by acquired Persean Sector technology.

Developed in conjuction with the Fleet Logistics Improvement Program, the Three Brothers Corporation was tasked with the designing of a new heavy logistics ship based on the newly developed Super Heavy Containers that was supposed to speed up cargo turnover times. While the project was successful, the limited amount of docks that can accommodate the new line of ships and its rarer Daedalus-type engine prevented the Pybara from becoming the new system standard for fleet cargo carriers.

Despite unfortunate shortcomings, Pybara captains and crew enjoy more spacious accommodations than the smaller Monax thanks to extensive automation and additional onboard facilities its fighter detachment. Pybaras feature a couple of people mover cars along its spines to quickly shunt people and materials around to the delight of onboard offduty crew and pilots.

At its core, the Pybara hosts a single Camel-Pattern Flux Reactor to power the large H101D Daedalus-type Fusion Torch while two Minuitoid Flux Reactors are responsible for pwoering the ship's various subsystems.",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_monax,SHIP,"The Monax is the workhorse of the Naval Logistics Fleet with its ample cargo holds and extensive salvaging equipment. Nothing on the ship’s base model is underutilized or an embellishment, every part of the Monax is designed to be easily interchangeable to fit the user’s needs while its cargo holds have been maximized to carry as many cargo units as possible with its powerful torch drive. 

The freighter is a collaboration between Kaharian Naval Steelworks and Jerel’s Fuel Haulers, now called the Three Brother's Corporation after merging, in an attempt to standardize Krysan cargo hauling. The project, being hugely successful, made the Monax the most common freighter to be seen flying in Krysan trade fleets. The Monax’ ubiquity and focus in standardization in Krysan cargo fleets created a barter economy that revolved around trading parts and also allowed dedicated businesses that are solely created for servicing Monax freighters.

The ship is equipped with an M405 Torch Drive that has been factory tuned for maximum efficiency and is hooked up to a single Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor.
",,,,
,,,,,,
rebelrats_panya,SHIP,"Despite its size, the Panya is more than capable of supporting local economies and small commerce fleets. Due to this, Federal Navy officers took interest in the ship's potential to extend the deep space endurance of flotillas as the ship was essentially nothing more than a few modular cargo holds with a fusion torch attached on its back. Like the Persean Sector's Buffalo, the Panya relies on escorts to carry it through its journeys safely.

The ship found its origins as a cheap solution to solving the shortage of service shuttles large enough to meet the growing demands of station constellations in Dragon's Blessing. Overtime, the Panya was able to grow out a niche of being the first choice for upcoming Krysan starfarers looking for a cheap cargo ship that demanded little maintenance.

With its diminutive size, the Panya's interiors can only be described as utilitarian and more akin to that of terrestrial cargo ships with individual cabins to host its measly number of crew. Fortunately for the crew, the ship utilizes extensive automation to ease the level of workload, meaning that onboard accommodations are more spacious than its larger brothers.

The ship is equipped with a Lynx-pattern flux reactor to power its systems and a single M303 Fusion Torch tuned down for efficiency.",,,,
rebelrats_rott,SHIP,"The Rott is a humble fuel tanker that can be compared to the Persean Sector's Dram. The Rott has enough fuel in its tanks to double the fuel range of a flotilla. As such, the ship is often seen paired together with Panyas or other cargo haulers to extend the range of Krysan Expeditions.

Like the Panya, the ship was initially conceived by The Three Brothers Corporation as a way to address the lack of standardization within the grassroots level of Krysan space economy. With its barebones structure and open truss structure, the Rott can easily be configured by any captain to their taste without the need for specialized tools",,,,

#PLANETS,,,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_planet,CUSTOM,"The planet serves as an example of the nation’s conviction to its founding tenets, manifesting itself in the people's ability to heal the planet's grievous wounds earned from its long history of conflict.

Today, Krysa presents itself to the sector as one of the most prosperous places to visit, bearing natural features similar to that of Old Earth despite nearly turning into an arid hellscape more than half a century earlier. Upon closer inspection, scars of past conflicts can be seen from with huge craters long filled by fauna.",,,,
rebelrats_malus_planet,CUSTOM,"Lawless is the word that can describe Malus. Despite its arid wastelands, small settlements pockmark around the planet's remaining major water sources, ranging from hastily made shanty towns, to relatively well-built hab towns that host their own spaceports. Whatever authority available is largely self-imposed through the use of force with shady backroom deals and smuggling by undesirables as the norm in the major settlements.

It was only recent when it became a hub of pirate activity. Its history goes far back into the days of the Empire when rebels used Malus as a smuggling port which eventually developed into hubs for undesirables to flock towards which inevitably grew to become its own independent entity.
",,,,
rebelrats_magawa_moon,CUSTOM,"Gigantic orbital berths orbiting around the planet dutifully service the numerous civilian freighters who have arrived to load and offload their holds. Magawan defence stations in the horizon orbit ponderously as a reminder of the planet’s grim history of multiple bombardments.

Despite its scarred looks due to decades of conflict, Magawa hosts one of the largest subterranean complexes of fortresses in the sector. These were built during the time of the Penance War from the vast network of old mining tunnels. Today, many of the former surface emplacements have been converted into civilian use, with the biggest ones eventually developing into fully fledged dome cities.
",,,,
rebelrats_rodentia_planet,CUSTOM,"The humble green giant has been the source of many Krysan folk tales and superstitions, often cited by olden folks to be where gods reside with their mountains of emerald riches. However, in contrast, children often joke that the gas giant's vivid hue is a result of the sheer amount of rat flatulence.

Today, Rodentia is home to the largest orbital refineries of Krysa, fuelling the armadas of the Federal Navy and housing the berths of the Krysan Federal Auxiliary Corps. Around the planet, trade fleets can be observed using the green giant’s immense gravity to save fuel via slingshots, providing a beautiful demonstration of graceful gravitational manoeuvres akin to that of old Earth.",,,,
rebelrats_nutria_planet,CUSTOM,"Amusingly referred to as the system's supermarket, Nutria is home to the largest settlement of independent traders second only to the Asteroid Central Station. The city of Spalax can be seen with its concourse of markets spanning the breadth of the city next to its equally gigantic space port that accommodates the flow of trade between Krysa and the rest of the Persean Sector.
",,,,
rebelrats_tikus_gasGiant,CUSTOM,"Like Rodentia, Tikus I has orbital refineries dotting across the planet's office, routinely sending out teams to mine the giant of its precious gas. Tikus I is the beating heart of the system's inhabitants, providing the necessary fuel for interstellar return trips. The gas giant is expected to bolster the nation's fleets and economy for many generations as the colonies grow.",,,,
rebelrats_tikusII_planet,CUSTOM,"With relatively mild climates, rich ore and crop compatible soils, Tikus II easily became a prime target for Krysan colonisation efforts. While Tikus II is described as a jungle planet, it is far from being a single biome. Tikus II has a complex system of biomes with equatorial regions hosting the densest concentrations of flora and fauna while its highest peaks are just barely breathable for individuals due to the planet's thick atmosphere.",,,,
rebelrats_tikusIII_planet,CUSTOM,"Tikus III, despite its almost destitute geography, is host to numerous independent settlements that popped up during Krysan colonisation efforts. The settlements on the planet huddle around the systems of natural caves and tunnels that hosts the few places that settlers can actively grow food such as mushrooms and low-light crops.

Outside of what little crops can be exported, settlers also take to mining the pockets of gas and send it out to be refined on Tikus I as a external source of credits for the planet's economy.",,,,

rebelrats_rod_station,CUSTOM,A station built by Rebel Rat Industries to extract the resources of Rodentia.,,,,
rebelrats_outerstation,CUSTOM,"A station made of massive cobbled together asteroids, Asteroid Central Station serves as the home port for miners and smugglers in the system. The massive station was once a humble outpost owned by a now defunct mining company and later rapidly expanded out of necessity as numerous refugees fled to the outpost during the Penance War.

Despite its ponderous appearance, the station is lightly-armed with very few large guns to speak off. The few dedicated defence modules that can be seen are a handful of jury-rigged gun platforms not too dissimilar to those found on Pirate or Pather stations.
