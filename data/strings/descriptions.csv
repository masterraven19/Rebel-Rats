#SHIP WEAPONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_equalizer_l,WEAPON,"The Equalizer's ponderous shots can shatter even the thickest armor plates. Its origins are as old as the Krysan Federal Monarchy, with it seeing first use in the defence of Magawa from loyalist elements.",,,,
rebelrats_doldrums_l,WEAPON,"The Doldrums-Pattern railgun is the most capable weapon in the Khrysan Navy arsenal, firing devastating AM-tipped warheads. The Federal Navy built the Doldrums during Khrysan Orbital Defence Program but later retooled the railgun to install them on Krysan Cruisers and Battleships as per the new Mobile Defence Doctrine.",Does this show up?,,,
rebelrats_drummer_l,WEAPON,The Drummer is an offshoot development of the Doldrums-Pattern railgun family. It utilizes an electrothermal-chemical firing system and gauss coils to fire inert rods against enemy shields,,,,
rebelrats_goedendag_l,WEAPON,"Buried behind the stealth composite plating is a complex series of carefully engineered electromagnets, capacitors, and extensive cooling equipment snaking around a set of magazines connected to the ship’s internal ammo forges. The Goedendag railgun is built to give the Jerboa the firepower to square off with its peers if its onboard missiles aren’t sufficient.",,,,
rebelrats_mangonel_l,WEAPON,"At its core, the Mangonel is a reverse engineered TPC from a wrecked Onslaught. By overcharging the weapon, The Three Brothers Corporation magnified the damage of its shots beyond what the original TPC was designed for. Despite its ability to inflict horrific effects on enemy ships, the Mangonel has seen limited service in the Krysan Fleet due to its costly flux requirements.",,,,
rebelrats_nezulana_l,WEAPON,"A railgun designed by the rebel rats in order to break capital-grade shields. Following the success of the Drummer, the Nezulana utilizes a scaled-up version of the same electrothermal-chemical launch system to hurl saboted hyperdense penetrating rods at enemy shields.",,,,
rebelrats_salvo_autoloader,WEAPON,"Initially a testbed bed for the Porcellus Battlecruiser's missile tubes, the design is now installed in most of the Federal Navy's capital ships as a finisher weapon with its unparalleled reliability.",,,,

rebelrats_custodian_m,WEAPON,The Custodian brings the much needed capability to bring down multiple targets with a single shot. Its built-in autoloader ensures that the gun is quickly fed flak shells during battle.,,,,
rebelrats_muridae_m,WEAPON,"Created by The Three Brothers Corporation and leased to Rebel Rat Industries, the launcher fires hyper-charged plasma bolts that melt through armour and hull. However, its downside is its relatively high flux requirements and its tendency to overheat that limits its capabilities.",,,,
rebelrats_arratoi_m,WEAPON,These are powerful railguns that fire standard issue anti-shield rounds. The Arratoi were developed for the Rattus Modernization Project to augment the firepower of the Rattus against increasingly hardy spacecraft shields.,,,,
rebelrats_petard_m,WEAPON,"Using laser activated nuclear pellets in a reinforced chamber, the Petard is a terrifying weapon to be struck by. Barrel Rectifiers would guide the released energy into a concentrated beam as it exits the gun and produce horrific results if the hull is directly struck, working similar to that of Krysan Pest Control equipment.",,,,
rebelrats_braggador_m,WEAPON,"Created to bridge the gap between long ranged flak and smaller short ranged PD, the Braggador’s quad guns can easily shoot down enemy torpedoes or blunt incoming enemy bomber runs.",,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_salvo,WEAPON,Triple rack for Huntsman Torpedos,,,,
,,,,,,
#MUS HUNTSMAN AUTOLOADER,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsmanx2_m,WEAPON,These torpedo tubes serve as the Mus' main anti-ship weapon and it allows the Mus to punch above its weight class. The tubes utilize an autoloader derived from the Rattus that is directly linked to the Mus' onboard microforge.,,,,
,,,,,,

rebelrats_hwacha_s,WEAPON,"The Hwacha SRM takes inspiration from the Swarmer SRM, dutifully fulfilling atmospheric and non-atmospheric anti-fighter craft roles with high agility. ",,,,
rebelrats_ranger,WEAPON,"Developed from the turret of a SPAAG, the Ranger is a rapid-fire weapon adept at devastating missiles and fighters with its high rate of fire.",,,,
rebelrats_fowler,WEAPON,"Created from the large surplus amount of lower caliber cannons available after the Penance War, the Fowler is an amalgamation of 8 low caliber barrels grouped together to fire a wall of bullets, achieving accuracy by volume of fire.",,,,
rebelrats_culverin,WEAPON,"A simple weapon, the Culverin is the standard issue high-explosive light anti-ship weapon for the Krysan Navy. Its two internal magazines let it fire HE shells in rapid bursts.",,,,
rebelrats_longbow,WEAPON,"The Longbow is the standard issue light anti-shield weapon for the Khrysan Navy. It fires small inert rounds that are relatively effective against enemy shields, especially against frigates that have smaller flux cores.",,,,
rebelrats_huntsmanx2,WEAPON,Dual rack for the Huntsman Torpedo,,,,
rebelrats_hawker,WEAPON,The Hawker is a pirate's favorite. It utilizes time-fuzed canister shells to quickly bring down incoming groups of missiles,,,,
rebelrats_pyroclast,WEAPON,The Pyroclast is the Federal Navy's answer to the Reaper. It uses a hypercharged AM-shaped charge warhead with raw penetration values measured in kilometers to break through heavy ship armor. Its built-in thruster system ensures that it hits the target.,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_torp,WEAPON,"This is an autoloader that has been fitted into the ship's center weapons module. It can quickly reload Huntsman torpedoes, allowing the Rattus to conduct rapid strikes and replenish missiles through its onboard microforge.",,,,
rebelrats_ashford,WEAPON,"The Ashford is comparable to Persean Sector lasers with its signature variable lense that allows it to have a higher effective range than other Krysan PD weapons. It utilizes newly found materials mined in the sector to induce EMP arcs on targets, often disabling their engines and sending them on a death spiral.",,,,
rebelrats_poacher_s,WEAPON,"Favoring accuracy by volume like ancient CIWS designs, the Poacher was an anti-ship weapon that was handed PD duties. The turret's APIT shells coupled with an astounding rate of fire allows it to shred through destroyer-grade armor plating relatively quickly when enmassed.",,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTER WEAPONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_huntsman_f,WEAPON,"A fighter-mounted version of the Huntsman Torpedo stowed under the fuselage due to its size. The fighter's weight restrictions downsized the torpedo's warhead, but will still be sufficient to threaten ships, especially those with thin armor.",,,,
rebelrats_ranger_f,WEAPON,"A stripped-down version of the Ranger, the cannon has a decreased fire rate for better heat management and less velocity per shell to limit vibrations in the fighter's chassis.",,,,
rebelrats_hwacha_f,WEAPON,"Modified for fighter use, Hwachas have proven to be effective for fighters due to its speed and agility, so the weapon sees mass use throughout Krysan strike craft.",,,,
rebelrats_guardsman_f,WEAPON,Guardsman-Pattern turrets have their roots in old Krysan naval ship armaments as CIWS installations. They are the mainstay armaments of Hippo Skiffs and bombers due to their ubiquity and ability to function with minimal maintenance.,,,,
rebelrats_vaybchek,WEAPON,"Overcharged plasma mining tools, the Vaybchek purposefully overloads its mining cartridges to produce a higher output. This unsafe practice commonly led to premature breech explosions when done wrong, often injuring the crew.",,,,
rebelrats_pyroclast_f,WEAPON,"Removing the complex thruster system and fitted with a solid rocket motor, this version of the Pyroclast is meant to be fitted into the Olympian's magnetic bomb launcher.",,,,

rebelrats_falcon_f,WEAPON,A wing mounting bracket for falcons.,,,,
,,,,,,
#FIGHTERS,,,,,,
rebelrats_sultan,SHIP,"The Sultan is the Krysan Navy's premier fighter. It was built and designed by Rebel Rats to operate both in atmosphere and space, acting as a multi-role SSTO fighter. Its large arsenal of weapons is enough to deal with most enemies in battle space, especially with its underslung Huntsman torpedo to help it hunt larger spacecraft.",,,,
rebelrats_proctor,SHIP,"More of an engine than a fighter, the Proctor was created to counter the growing number of pirates in the Persean Sector. Its armaments allow it to hunt frigates, but it quickly falters against concentrated enemy PD fire with its lack of shields despite extensive armoring around crucial internal systems.",,,,
rebelrats_hippo,SHIP,"The Hippo is the standard-issue skiff of Krysan Federal Navy warships. They allow Krysan Ships to insert a platoon of marines into a planetary battlespace or initiate boarding action agaisnt enemy ships and stations with breaching charges. Outside of dropship duties, the skiffs can act as impromptu PD boats to screen its mothership with its Guardsman turrets.",,,,
rebelrats_overseer,SHIP,"A light interceptor of the Krysan Federal Navy, the Overseer is a hardy fighter created by Arms & Armor. The craft comes equipped with a Hwacha missile rack and a pair of Ranger autocannons, making a wing of Overseers a threat to enemy shields.",,,,
rebelrats_ministro,SHIP,"The Ministro is a lightweight, unmanned interceptor drone designed by Rebel Rat Industries as a proposal to Krysan Navy officials to reduce pilot losses. It quickly found success with increasingly advanced drone control systems that allowed finer control with unmanned drones.",,,,
rebelrats_patron_f,SHIP,An array of microforges have been set up on this carrier to maintain a wing of Patron Corvettes. ,,,,
rebelrats_daekon,SHIP,A fast assault fighter built to break the shields of the enemy spacecraft and shred their armor with assault chainguns.,,,,
,,,,,,
#BOMBERS,,,,,,
rebelrats_olympian,SHIP,"Despite its shambolic origins of being made from the remains of Piranha bombers, the Olympian is a capable bomber that dutifully does its job with more than enough armor and PD coverage to last it through its bombing run. A recurring joke among Olympian pilots is that the onboard warhead contains a Red Bombardier Rat as its payload.",,,,
rebelrats_bluster,SHIP,The Bluster has its origins from juryrigged shuttlecraft in mining fleets around Asteroid Central Station who looked for a temporary solution to the growing pirate problem. A salvaged guardsman turret sits on top of the Bluster's engine block to serve as all around protection against enemy fightercraft.,,,,
,,,,,,
#COMBAT SHIPS ,,,,,,
rebelrats_porcellus,SHIP,"Bristling with weaponry and cladded in thick composites, the Porcellus is the most common capital ship found in Krysan Federal Navy battlegroups. It also carries a pair of skiffs in its hangars that can conduct rapid military insertions, or act as PD screens during engagements.

The Porcellus is designed by the Arms and Armor Conglomerate and is built in the massive orbital berths of Kaharian Naval Steelworks. Being based off of a venerable design in the days of the Empire, the prototype model initially lacked effective PD coverage and long-ranged weaponry, but improvements to PD designs and new technologies brought by the Mobile Defence Doctrine made the Porcellus one of the safest ships in the Krysan Federal Navy.

At the ship’s core, four Barkley-Pattern Heavy-Duty AM-catalysed flux reactors are responsible for powering the ship’s Basilica-Model shield generator and its set of four massive H303 Torch Drives and two secondary H302 Torch Drives.
",,,,
rebelrats_marmot,SHIP,"Marmot Heavy Cruisers form the backbone of Krysan Battlegroups. The ship’s modular weapon mounts and sizeable hangars means that the ship can fill most roles that admirals may require. The Marmot is the first ship to be officially equipped with the Doldrums-Pattern Superheavy Railgun for the Navy’s newly conceived Mobile Defence Doctrine, allowing the ship to bring station-grade weaponry to battle.

Designed by Veronica Witherfield, Rebel Rats Head Designer, the ship is often made squadron leader in Vanguard Fleets as command centres for captains conducting mercantile protection. During pitched battles, the Marmot serves as second-line warships to provide fire support and fighter craft coverage for capital ships. The heavy cruiser is notable for its performance during the Siege of Nutria when squadrons of Marmot cruisers and Rattus destroyers broke through Remnant forces and lifted the siege with their captain’s quick thinking which minimized the loss of ships.

Equipped with two M405 Torch Drives, the Marmot can easily manoeuvre around the battlefield to take advantage of opportunities. The ship is powered by two Barkley-Pattern Heavy-Duty AM-catalysed flux reactors that power the ship’s torch drives and dual shield generators.
",,,,
rebelrats_jerboa,SHIP,"The Jerboa is the Federal Navy’s stealth cruiser. It employs redundant layers of stealth composites reduce sensor profile to conduct covert special operations. However, for the occasional ship-to-ship engagements, its Goedendag railgun provide the necessary firepower to duel enemy ships brave enough to spar with the ship.

Built by The Three Brothers Corporation, the Jerboa is the mainstay warship of the Krysan Special Operations Command and is commonly used in commerce raiding and special recon missions. Apart from the Goedendag, the Jerboa is equipped with a couple of composite mounts and a small hangar bay that can be modified to suit the needs of the given mission.

The ship uses two heavily modified M503 Torch Drives fed by three Sleipnir-Pattern Hyper Cooled flux reactors. Apart from its use of stealth composites, the Jerboa also runs extensive hull cooling systems to hide it in the infrared spectrum, often storing the waste heat in its massive heat sinks or recycle it back to auxiliary systems until the ship can dump it out safely.
",,,,
rebelrats_matkaboska,SHIP,"Despite lacking the mounts for a Doldrums, the Matka Boska makes up for it with copious modular firepower and armor. The ship has a solid reputation for keeping its crew safe during heavy engagements thanks to its armor layout. Due to this apparent hardiness, the ship became a favorite for officers to use as command ships.

The Matka Boska was unfortunately conceived right before the creation of the Mobile Defence Doctrine. Due to this, the ship does not have the correct mountings nor a sufficient reactor to accommodate the Doldrums. Instead, the ship relies on thick slabs of ablative armour and an arsenal of missiles to even out its fights.

The design of the ship predates that of the Marmot and even resembles that of archaic Krysan warships due to Rebel Rat engineers taking direct inspiration from said ships and so, taking design cues from older ships, the Matka Boska not only boasts heavier armour than its contemporaries, but also better structural integrity and hardier citadels to keep its crew safe during engagements.

The ship is equipped with two Barkley-Pattern AM-catalysed flux reactors to power its singular H305 Torch Drive and its Basilica-Model shield generator. Multiple redundant systems are in place to make sure that the ship can get the crew back to safety.
",,,,
rebelrats_mellivora,SHIP,"Though lightly armed and armoured, the Mellivora’s high-capacity hangars provide the fighter cover for itself and other ships in the fleet. It heavily relies on its speed and fighters to keep enemy ships at distance and to strike opponents.

Realizing the need for a mobile light carrier, Krysan High Command commissioned Arms & Armor to design a light carrier with high mobility. And so, with Arms & Armor having prior carrier building experience from creating the Porcellus, the development for the Mellivora was quick and had no difficulties.

Mellivora crews are treated to new facilities that are much more comfortable than on older ships. Though, unfortunately, the onboard amenities are found to be smaller given the size of the ship and the size of the crew, with the galley often crowded by crew members lounging during downtime. 

The ship is equipped with 4 M505 and is powered with the latest model flux reactors. For the Mellivora’s size, its onboard hangar facilities are comparatively more spacious for its designed capacity than on bigger ships such as the Marmot and Porcellus, increasing crew comfort during carrier operations.
",,,,
rebelrats_monax_p,SHIP,"Taking advantage of the Monax's commonality, pirates have replaced the internals of its cargo bays with snaking munition belts and armor plates. What used to be its cargo door has been replaced by hangar bays and its shuttle bays turned into concealed missile tubes. The extensive up gunning and armouring to the hull has earned it the light cruiser classification.

While two Monax(P)s are seemingly alike, the lack of standardization with the pirate modifications of Monax(P)s means that no two ships are completely the same. One ship may sport slightly thicker armor while another may be having larger flux batteries.

Despite extensive upgrades to the hull, an inexperienced captain can be easily caught off guard in battle if they get too greedy in their Monax(P). Any pirate captain experienced enough knows that the ship is never able to fight peer to peer with its lackluster flux reactor core and jury-rigged shield module.
",,,,
rebelrats_rattus,SHIP,"The Rattus is an ancient design that predates the Krysan Federal Navy. The design was extensively updated by the Rebel Rats Head of Design, Violet Witherfield, giving it new Arratoi railguns to crack enemy shields, a new AM-catalysed flux reactor to power the ship’s new shield system, and an onboard micro-forge to reload its torpedo launcher.

Dubbed as “The Blue Angel”, the Rattus was instrumental during Penance Day when disillusioned captains led a massive rebellion against the Krysan Empire, leading to a brutal 8-year long civil war that would culminate in the dissolution of the Empire and the formation of the Federal Monarchy of Krysa. During the rebellion, Rattus destroyers were used in guerrilla tactics and rapid insertion of rebel forces into orbital stations to seize decommissioned empire ships.

Following the principles of thrust-gravity oriented design, the Rattus has a narrow hull with a vertical layout, leading to a smaller front cross section that allows Rattus captains to minimize the chances of the enemy landing a hit, though to the disdain of crewmembers needing to navigate up and down the ship’s tight vertical spaces.
",,,,
rebelrats_helmsman,SHIP,"Despite its makeshift appearance, the Helmsman’s barebones design gives it outstanding agility with its outrigged RCS thrusters. Its onboard shield generator was ripped off of a salvaged Monax cargo ship and tuned to the size of the Helmsman. Despite this, the ship is surprisingly adequately armed for its size, but can’t handle similarly sized ships that have proper flux cores.

With captains that can only be described as desperate daredevils with no regard for their own indemnity, the Helmsman is manually constructed in the hands of any person desperate enough with the wanderlust for star travel or piracy. Its interior spaces are cramped and reminiscent of planetary submersibles with parts of the crew sleeping in bunks with very little room or privacy. 

Its fusion torch engine is usually homebrewed from a Frankenstein of parts while its flux reactor is usually a Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor taken from a Monax.
",,,,
rebelrats_mus,SHIP,"Bearing unparalleled speed and brash firepower, the Mus is a menace on the battlefield when left unattended. The ship’s built-in plasma launchers and torpedo tubes allow it to spar with larger ships while its new S501 Fusion Torch gives it the speed to easily keep up with enemy frigates.

Rebel Rat Industries created the Mus to serve alongside the Rattus as its escort. As the newest addition to the Krysan Federal Navy, the Mus enjoys better shield generators that are more efficient and provides wider coverage than older shield models.

Despite being a recent addition, the Mus quickly became a common sight along Krysan trade routes as a pursuit ship against any roving pirate.
",,,,
rebelrats_patron,SHIP,"A corvette built to provide laser PD coverage for ships, the Patron can use its bow mounted Felis LAWS to quickly sweep through fighter formations. However, ironically, due to its diminutive size, the Patron is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by fighters if it operates alone due to the Felis LAWS’ limited firing arc.

Created by Arms & Armor, there was no expenses spared in the creation of the Patron. The interior has been carefully modelled to house the 4-man cockpit as comfortably as possible. The designer had even included a dedicated galley for the crew, which, as small as it is, goes a long way during long voyages. Unfortunately, this meant that the vessel has little in the way of protection, being comparable to that on armoured fighter craft.

The corvette is one of the few deep space ships that still maintains older-type fusion engines, that being two XS801 Pion Pulse Fusion Engines. The ship’s energy is maintained by a side mounted Minuitoid flux reactor, a fairly recent development in the miniaturization of technology.
",,,,
,,,,,,
#LOGISTICS SHIPS,,,,,,
rebelrats_pybara,SHIP,"The penultimate cargo carrier of the Naval Logistics Fleet, the Pybara's built around the relatively new Super Heavy Containers to satisfy the increasing needs of Krysan Federal Navy. Uniquely, its size can be attributed to the hull being designed around a Daedalus-type fusion torch that utilizes features inspired by acquired Persean Sector technology.

Developed in conjuction with the Fleet Logistics Improvement Program, the Three Brothers Corporation was tasked with the designing of a new heavy logistics ship based on the newly developed Super Heavy Containers that was supposed to speed up cargo turnover times. While the project was successful, the limited amount of docks that can accommodate the new line of ships and its rarer Daedalus-type engine prevented the Pybara from becoming the new system standard for fleet cargo carriers.

Despite unfortunate shortcomings, Pybara captains and crew enjoy more spacious accommodations than the smaller Monax thanks to extensive automation and additional onboard facilities its fighter detachment. Pybaras feature a couple of people mover cars along its spines to quickly shunt people and materials around to the delight of onboard offduty crew and pilots.

At its core, the Pybara hosts a single Camel-Pattern Flux Reactor to power the large H101D Daedalus-type Fusion Torch while two Minuitoid Flux Reactors are responsible for pwoering the ship's various subsystems.",,,,
rebelrats_monax,SHIP,"The Monax is the workhorse of the Naval Logistics Fleet with its ample cargo holds and extensive salvaging equipment. Nothing on the ship’s base model is underutilized or an embellishment, every part of the Monax is designed to be easily interchangeable to fit the user’s needs while its cargo holds have been maximized to carry as many cargo units as possible with its powerful torch drive. 

The freighter is a collaboration between Kaharian Naval Steelworks and Jerel’s Fuel Haulers, now the Three Brother's Corporation, in an attempt to standardize Krysan cargo hauling. The project, being hugely successful, made the Monax the most common freighter to be seen flying in Krysan trade fleets. The Monax’ ubiquity and focus in standardization in Krysan cargo fleets created a barter economy that revolved around trading parts and dedicated businesses meant for servicing Monax freighters.

The ship is equipped with a M405 Torch Drive that has been factory tuned for maximum efficiency and is hooked up to a single Bobcat-Pattern Flux Reactor.

#PLANETS,,,,,,
rebelrats_rattus_planet,CUSTOM,"The planet serves as the ultimate symbol of the people’s conviction to the Federation’s founding tenets, manifesting itself in the nation’s ability to heal grievous wounds from brutal interplanetary conflicts that brought the planet to its knees.

Today, Krysa presents itself to the sector as one of the cleanest and most prosperous places to visit, bearing natural features similar to that of Old Earth despite the planet nearly turning into an arid hellscape more than half a century earlier. Upon closer inspection, scars of past conflicts can be seen with huge craters formed from explosions having been filled over long ago by Mother Nature.",,,,
rebelrats_malus_planet,CUSTOM,"Lawless is what can describe Malus. Despite its arid wastelands, small settlements pockmark around the planet's remaining major water sources, ranging from hastily made shanty towns, to relatively well-built hab towns that host their own spaceports. Whatever authority discovered is largely self-imposed through the use of force with shady backroom deals and smuggling by undesirables as the norm in those settlements.

It was only recent when it became a hub of pirate activity. Its history goes far back into the days of the Empire when rebels used Malus as a smuggling port which eventually developed into hubs for undesirables to flock towards which inevitably grew to become its own independent entity.
",,,,
rebelrats_magawa_moon,CUSTOM,"Gigantic orbital berths can be seen dutifully servicing civilian freighters who have come to load their holds full of newly mined ores towards the outer belt. Magawan defence stations in the horizon orbit ponderously as a grim reminder of the planet’s recent grim history.

Despite its unforgiving looks due to previous decades of conflict, Magawa hosts one of the largest subterranean complexes of fortresses in the sector that were built during the time of the Penance War from old mining tunnels; many of the former surface emplacements have been converted into viewing domes for leisure, with some developing into fully fledged dome cities.
",,,,
rebelrats_rodentia_planet,CUSTOM,"The humble green giant has been the source of many Krysan folk tales and superstitions, often cited by olden folks to be where gods reside together with their emerald riches. However, in contrast, the children often joke that the gas giant is actual full of rat flatulence due to its vivid green hue.

Nowadays, Rodentia is home to the largest orbital fuel refineries of the system, fuelling the armadas of the Federal Navy and houses the berthing of the ships of the Krysan Federal Auxiliary Corps. Diligent haulers and trade fleets can be observed using the gas giant’s immense gravity to save fuel via slingshots, which provides a constant show of graceful gravitational manoeuvres.",,,,
rebelrats_nutria_planet,CUSTOM,"Amusingly referred to as the system's supermarket, Nutria is home to the largest settlement of independent traders second only to the Asteroid Central Station. Due to its proximity to the warp gates, Nutria is the first point of contact for many Persean captains looking to visit the system for the first time.

#STATIONS,,,,,,
rebelrats_powerstation,CUSTOM,A collector station designed by The Three Brothers Corporation to consume the power of the sun and beam it back to Krysan orbital power stations.,,,,
rebelrats_powerstation_interaction,CUSTOM,"As your fleet approaches the power station you suddenly recieve a warning notification to not to approach the station any closer. Your gunnery officer alarms the bridge that several targetting lasers from the station are painting your fleet, prompting your officers to advise against any notion of further approaching the station.",,,,
rebelrats_rod_station,CUSTOM,A station made by Rebel Rat Industries in order to extract the resources of Rodentia.,,,,
rebelrats_outerstation,CUSTOM,"A station made out of massive asteroids that have been cobbled together. Asteroid Central Station serves as a refuelling site for miners and smugglers. The massive station is the home of the people who are the ancestors of the many refugees who fled to the Outer Maw during the Penance War.

Despite its ponderous appearance, the station is comparatively lightly-armed with very few large guns to speak off. The few dedicated defence modules that can be seen are a handful of jury-rigged gun platforms not too dissimilar to those found on Pirate or Pather stations.
