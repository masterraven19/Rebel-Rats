However, what should have been a typical meeting turned into a peculiarity. Instead, you are greeted by an image of a shoddily drawn character with rodent ears. The image would light up whenever she spoke.

""Greetings, starfarer! How may I help you?""

""Hoh... What may be of your interest with Krysa starfarer. May it be history, culture and what's its?""

The voice was almost boisterous as if they've puffed up their chest. It was almost reassuringly insulting that someone was this energetic in this decaying sector.","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview:""What exactly is Krysa? I have read the pamphlet packets, but I want to hear from a Krysan.""

Her voice had become more energetic, as if some curtain had been unfurled. The shoddy drawing then reserves itself to the corner as an infographic slides into view. You felt as if a mistake had been made as she took an audibly long breath.

""As you may have read on the information pamphlets, Krysa is the Federated States of Krysa's seat of power and houses the Directorial Assembly, the governing entity of the nation.""","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview2:Continue listening

A manual presentation in this day and age? This person is really eccentric. It makes one wonder if the rest of the planet is like her, using archaic trinkets and doodads in their daily lives. Onwards, the next slide was more expansive, portraying what seems to be a map of Krysa's geography and key landmarks.

""If you may, the closest example of a planet I could compare Krysa is Gilead. Despite its beauty, the planet used to be barren, ravaged by past conflict, yet, with the will of the gods and the people's resolute determination, the planet was restored to the beauty it is today.""
