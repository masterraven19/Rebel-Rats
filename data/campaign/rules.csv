FireBest MarketPostDock","Passing through the shuttle's doors, Port 11 brimmed with activity as people from all walks of life went about their daily routine, unbothered by the eclectic set of shuttles coming in and out of the island spaceport. Climbing up the elevator tothe massive accoustic walls, employees from the menagerie of pop-up shops and market stalls perched up along the wall next to the tram station bombarded the crew with various offers and deals.

Taking a tram to the mainland, children can be seen dashing their way around spacers in the wide spaces of the tram hub, some tailing along with their parents, others rushing in groups to the stalls at the end of the concourse, attracted by the smell of fresh bread, melted cheese, and grilled meat mingling together and wafting in the air.

Beyond the menial food vendors of the concourse, a large hallway gave way to a number of wide-ranging shops in the bazaar who sold more niche items such as cyberware, or even the occasional starship parts; peering closer into nearby conversations, Persean wares seems to be all the madness for the guileless inhabitants.

With such a warm atmosphere, Krysa is almost like a home away from home.",,

Passing the shoddy airlock, the grungy yellow-lit hallways of New Eden Cove gave way to loose crowds of immigrants and undesirables huddling around eclectic makeshift shanties, occasionally lit by the blare of exterior sunlight coming from the transparent dome above. Looking down from the windows, processions of railcars, maintenance drones, and elevators of all manner snake down the underground caverns, marked by a procession of lights as their evidence of existence.

Passing by the droves of arrivals, an overbuilt security checkpoint manned by armed guards marked the end of the hallway, leading up to a platform of elevators which led to the underground portion of New Eden Cove.",,

The familiar sight of hab blocks and commercial skyscrapers marked the skies while a carnival of huge holo-ads, fly overs, and city lights illuminated the streets below. Most prominent was the cast mechant's bazaars that propped themselves along Spalax City's huge avenues like they were walls of separation.

Landing on one of the destitute landing pad outside the settlement, one of the settlers came to meet the shuttle crew and act as a guide. A simple glance at its gates hinted that one did not need to enter to know that their stay on the settlement would be unpleasant, menial at best.

What should have been a typical meeting turned into a peculiarity. Instead of a normal holovid, an image of a shoddily drawn character with rodent ears greets you and your crew with it lighting up whenever she spoke.

A subtle clink of a cup in the background can be heard as the image lit up again as the person spoke.

""Hoh... What may be of your interest with Krysa starfarer. May it be history, or our culture and what's its?""

The voice was almost boisterous as if they've puffed up their chest. It was almost reassuringly insulting that someone was this energetic in this decaying sector. You wonder if they even know the current state of the sector.","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview1:""I have read the pamphlet packets, but I want to hear from a Krysan what Krysa is.""
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysafood:""I'm curious, what exactly do Krysans eat. Do they like cheese as much as in the stories?""

Her voice had become more energetic, as if some curtain had been unfurled. The shoddy drawing then reserves itself to the corner as an infographic slides portraying six coat of arms under the Krysan flag. You felt as if a mistake had been made as she took an audibly long breath.

""As you may have read on the information pamphlets, Krysa is the seat of power for the Federated States of Krysa and houses the Directorial Assembly, the governing entity of the nation. They are the collective members of the 6 founding states, namely: The Kaharian Principality, The Alenian Federal Republic, United Clans of Sandar, Kingdom of Taledia, Republic of Zestiel, and the Collective Houses of the Neusian Ritters.""

It was more expansive, portraying what seems to be a map of Krysa's geography and key landmarks. Aside from that, a manual presentation in this day and age? It makes one wonder if the rest of the planet is like her, using archaic trinkets and doodads in their daily lives.

""The closest example that I could compare to Krysa, if you may, is Gilead. The planet used to be barren believe it or not! Its surface was severely ravaged during the Penance War. Yet, by the will of the gods and resolute determination, the planet was restored to the beauty that it is today through the Ratze-Potkan Rejuvenation Program.""

Pausing for a moment, a flip of the page can be heard right before she continued to speak. Your group of officers show a mix of intrigue and a rising sense of boredom.

""You can see the damage today, especially from orbit. Mostly by the work of abominable machines, with a handful of the impact sites having been converted into memorials such as the Grand Memorial Park that I oblige all of you to visit.""","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview3:""Yeah...""",

""If I may, I can see that your crew are getting restless. I would  ideally recommend staying here at the starport mainland where hotels and resorts are widely available, but, for today I suggest taking a shuttle or a tram to the tip of the peninsula. 

The crowds there are smaller and the beaches are equally beautiful and sport calmer waters. That is, if you can contend with smaller resorts.""
