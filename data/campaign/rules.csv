What should have been a typical meeting turned into a peculiarity. Instead of a normal holo, you are greeted by an image of a shoddily drawn character with rodent ears. The image would light up whenever she spoke.

""Greetings, starfarer! I am Foreign Relations Officer, Nazarin Dess. How may I help you?""","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysa:""Can I ask something about Krysa?""
rebelrats_nazar_aboutRats:""Why are you a picture?""
rebelrats_nazar_cheese:""Do you like cheese?""
rebelrats_nazar_escortOpt:""I'm kinda looking for awesome officers does krysa have some?""",
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysa,DialogOptionSelected,$option == rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysa,,"One can almost imagine the ears of the shoddily drawn rat perking up in anticipated silence after hearing the question. A subtle clink of a cup in the background can be heard as the image lit up again as the person spoke.

""Hoh... What may be of your interest with Krysa starfarer. May it be history, or our culture and what's its?""

The voice was almost boisterous as if they've puffed up their chest. It was almost reassuringly insulting that someone was this energetic in this decaying sector. You wonder if they even know the current state of the sector.","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview1:""I have read the pamphlet packets, but I want to hear from a Krysan what Krysa is.""
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysafood:""I'm curious, what exactly do Krysans eat. Do they like cheese as much as in the stories?""
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysadomain:""I have read the info packets about Krysa, but is Krysa a former Domain colony?""",
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview1,DialogOptionSelected,$option == rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview1,,"It didn't take long for the image to light up again. Her voice had become more energetic, as if some curtain had been unfurled. The shoddy drawing then reserves itself to the corner as an infographic slides portraying six coat of arms under the Krysan flag. You felt as if a mistake had been made as she took an audibly long breath.

""As you may have read on the information pamphlets, Krysa is the Federated States of Krysa's seat of power and houses the Directorial Assembly, the governing entity of the nation. They are the collective members of the 6 founding states, namely: The Kaharian Principality, The Alenian Federal Republic, United Clans of Sandar, Kingdom of Taledia, Republic of Zestiel, and the Collective Houses of the Neusian Ritters.""

A brief pause lingered before she continued.

""Still following me, Starfarer?""","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview2:Continue listening
",
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview2,DialogOptionSelected,$option == rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview2,,"An audible clunk was heard before the infographic switches to the next slide. It was more expansive, portraying what seems to be a map of Krysa's geography and key landmarks. Aside from that, a manual presentation in this day and age? It makes one wonder if the rest of the planet is like her, using archaic trinkets and doodads in their daily lives.

""The closest example of a planet I could compare to Krysa, if you may, is Gilead. The planet used to be barren believe it or not! It had been severely ravaged by past conflicts. Yet, with the will of the gods and the people's resolute determination, the planet was restored to the beauty it is today through the Ratze-Potkan Planet Rejuvenation Program.""

Pausing for a moment, a flip of the page can be heard right before she continued to speak. Your group of officers show a mix of intrigue and a rising sense of boredom.

""Today you can see some evidence of such catastrophic damage on your way down from orbit. One of such craters were as a result of an asteroid strike. The people have converted it into the Remembrance Park to stand as a reminder of those who fell fighting for Krysa. The nearby shuttle terminal can take you there directly.""","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview3:""Yeah...""
",
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview3,DialogOptionSelected,$option == rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview3,FireAll PopulateOptions,"There were two clinks heard. The next slide was a list of the local bars, resorts, hotels, or local attractions.

""If I may, I can see that your crew are getting boorish  the best location to lounge in for a vacation here is, ideally, here at the starport where hotels and resorts are widely available. But, I would suggest taking a shuttle to the tip of the peninsula. The crowds are smaller there and the beaches are equally beautiful.""

Another clink and the slides disappeared to be replaced by Nazarin's icon.

""Thank you for listening, Starfarer.""",,

Despite a slight pause, she continued talking before you were able to ask a follow up question.

""However, I can request a shuttle to take you to the Fialot Library if you wish to inquire further. The scholars there may be more knowledgeable on thsi matter than I am.""",,
