Pass the port security checkpoints, children can be seen dashing their way around spacers in the concourse, some going with their parents, attracted by the smell of fresh bread, melted cheese, and grilled meat mingling together and wafting in the air.

Beyond the menial food vendors were the wide-ranging shops in the bazaar who sold more niche items such as cyberhardware, or even the occasional starship parts; Persean wares seems to be all the madness for the guileless rodents.

Passing the airlock, the yellow-lit hallways of New Eden Cove gave way to loose crowds of immigrants and undesirables huddling around makeshift dwellings, occasionally lit by the blare of the exterior sunlight. Looking down from the windows, processions of railcars, maintenance drones, and elevators of all manner snake down the underground caverns, marked by a procession of lights as their evidence of existence.

Passing by the droves of arrivals, an overbuilt security checkpoint, manned by armed guards, marked the end of the hallway which lead up to one of the elevators to the underground portion of New Eden Cove.",,

The familiar sight of hab blocks and commercial skyscrapers marked the skies, and a carnival of huge holo-ads, fly overs, and city lights illuminated the streets. Most prominent was the mechant's district that propped itself along Spalax City's huge avenues like they were walls of separation.

Landing on one of the destitute landing pad outside the settlement, one of the settlers came to meet the shuttle crew and act as a guide. A simple glance at its gates hinted that one did not need to enter to know that their stay on the settlement would be unpleasant, menial at best.

What should have been a typical meeting turned into a peculiarity. Instead of a normal holovid, an image of a shoddily drawn character with rodent ears greets you and your crew with it lighting up whenever she spoke.

A subtle clink of a cup in the background can be heard as the image lit up again as the person spoke.

""Hoh... What may be of your interest with Krysa starfarer. May it be history, or our culture and what's its?""

The voice was almost boisterous as if they've puffed up their chest. It was almost reassuringly insulting that someone was this energetic in this decaying sector. You wonder if they even know the current state of the sector.","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview1:""I have read the pamphlet packets, but I want to hear from a Krysan what Krysa is.""
rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysafood:""I'm curious, what exactly do Krysans eat. Do they like cheese as much as in the stories?""

Her voice had become more energetic, as if some curtain had been unfurled. The shoddy drawing then reserves itself to the corner as an infographic slides portraying six coat of arms under the Krysan flag. You felt as if a mistake had been made as she took an audibly long breath.

""As you may have read on the information pamphlets, Krysa is the Federated States of Krysa's seat of power and houses the Directorial Assembly, the governing entity of the nation. They are the collective members of the 6 founding states, namely: The Kaharian Principality, The Alenian Federal Republic, United Clans of Sandar, Kingdom of Taledia, Republic of Zestiel, and the Collective Houses of the Neusian Ritters.""

It was more expansive, portraying what seems to be a map of Krysa's geography and key landmarks. Aside from that, a manual presentation in this day and age? It makes one wonder if the rest of the planet is like her, using archaic trinkets and doodads in their daily lives.

""The closest example of a planet I could compare to Krysa, if you may, is Gilead. The planet used to be barren believe it or not! It had been severely ravaged by past conflicts. Yet, with the will of the gods and the people's resolute determination, the planet was restored to the beauty it is today through the Ratze-Potkan Planet Rejuvenation Program.""

Pausing for a moment, a flip of the page can be heard right before she continued to speak. Your group of officers show a mix of intrigue and a rising sense of boredom.

""Today you can see some evidence of such catastrophic damage on your way down from orbit. One of such craters were as a result of an asteroid strike. The people have converted it into the Remembrance Park to stand as a reminder of those who fell fighting for Krysa. The nearby shuttle terminal can take you there directly.""","rebelrats_nazar_aboutKrysaoverview3:""Yeah...""",

But, I would suggest taking a shuttle to the tip of the peninsula. The crowds are smaller there and the beaches are equally beautiful.""
